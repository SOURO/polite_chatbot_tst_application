new york -(dow jones)- banks prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to markets , as they to the changing requirements of the basel accord on capital requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure to derivatives as one area where broader and more tightly models of credit risk are to be a future requirement for banks .
york federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk regulatory capital : issues and options , " is publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference to derivatives and to the possible for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk was n't based on specific problems in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise to a material extent on market , standards likely would require models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
she also gave an example in of how a chain of events might lower the worth of a credit for a bank .
to the basel accord , planned for introduction by 2004 , aim the way that banks globally for risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund manager at sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors to buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually in six months to one year , offer higher rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops below that level , the return at the bond 's maturity lower than investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who can file under chapter 13 and who file under chapter 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference appointed out differences between the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously at a 60 handle suddenly be tendered at par .
important insurance credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay interest on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
because of the product , loan portfolio managers sides of the atlantic have morphed in recent years into active traders , while insurance company and hedge fund managers gained a way to position themselves .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy if there 's a glimmer of a company may turn around .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly could have considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a loan if it had couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path would have avoided default .
the credit has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products , and although it has n't yet reached a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation may hurt overall market liquidity .
for example , would a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million credit default swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans that thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a default trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a better standard for interdealer business , or risk less liquidity and a of added basis risk within dealer books .
although achieving consensus will not , kennaugh 's is that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike established .
the language to accomplish require some drafting , but the goal give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while of swaps would still maintain the regulatory tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , a " two - step delivery option .
on of a loan restructuring , the holder of a credit default swap either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy at a .
in other words , be one central contract , but with a new delivery twist within it .
it introduce too much uncertainty into the delivery process .
given the large of underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here even more difficult for participants to agree on .
such an approach result mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people what contracts they trade , and have to wait which contract be .
if banks still relief with restructuring included , that price exists today and will continue to exist .
it 's easy to imagine yet another xerox may technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but for xerox since there is more money on the table .
credit problems flare up , come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market .
it has been approved by ben and chris booth and should to sandridge today .

diesel plants spark concern they 're expected to generate big air - quality problems when summer blackouts hit .
some are clean , they have been built or retrofitted in the years .
kind of statewide policy on when and where use the diesel generators , " said gino dicaro , a spokesman for the california manufacturers and technology association .

delegates at the bonn climate change negotiations are expected through saturday decisions " and give full effect " to the agreement .
, developed countries the u.s. on board and this leaves room for the bush administration an alternative -- though the close .
however , have a role in complying with emissions reduction obligations .
it is too early to tell impact competitiveness or whether they will be interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .
, only parties to the protocol can the market - based under the protocol ( emissions trading , - mechanisms in through the clean development mechanism , based mechanisms in other developed countries through joint implementation ) .
because the details are not yet , it is unclear whether enron to participate in mechanisms or offices in other countries outside the u.s.
be important that the u.s. linkages with the market - based mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations .
this could more costly and burdensome reductions in for u.s. firms ( as the u.s. a more stringent target to meet ) .
clean mechanism and ji nuclear power projects are not permitted under the cdm or ji afforestation and reforestation are the only eligible sequestration under the cdm small project " fast track " window in the cdm for renewable energy < 15 mw , for efficiency and other equivalent to less than 15 gwh per year , and emitting reduce emissions and with emissions of less than 15,000 tons per year .
most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as to close out the month of july .
not to go there seemed to be a lot of issues which when combined caused the saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday .
jeff johnson and his team are putting a plan that will address most of and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go bidweek and close for august .
the tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become hogs as the amount of data grows .
and hopefully migrate to the of sybase which will address some of the issues .
also require some hardware to where we store certain data .
we user stress prior .
this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions what if any action should be taken transactions .
once have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we 've been via eol then delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions .
have to it is the right solution in the long term .
be with some of you to go over a much plan .
keep you we roll out the tactical solutions .

i am leaving with regret , as i all of you , and i believe ebs is poised for .
in a , i this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am working on , and about .
again , many , and for what i have learned about broadband and ebs from each of you .
not on the application until we decide what legal entity to use .
this is a option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not at cross purposes with other parts of the government that to ebs with incentives .
for example it that jan haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i believe on this that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe it would still be prudent had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( as we have in and japan ) for the purpose of guiding us sorts of ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working group headed by wayne gardner .
the contacts i with are andy haire and yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore for a meeting to question them much of this they to do independently without reliance on us .
so , to be awarded pioneer status , which the edb is very willing to consider after many months of persuasion , i believe edb demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
the idea is to get adl to perform the quantitative economic development analysis not do in - house .
( d ) direct edb on ebs 's plans edb ( chelsia lim ) has this week asked ebs her on its for singapore .
i have made craig clark the responsibility for this is handled .
( a ) status of system configuration plan : the plan is draft and is being held pending a decision to be communicated by roger estrada within the or two as to whether the lucent 10 g equipment described in the to .
the hk lawyers ( michelle chan of clifford ) have said that if we plan to at the outset , we ought to just wait and in the correct description rather than revise .
when the system configuration plan is done in final , we to change the listed destination in the from " san jose " to " west coast usa , japan , singapore , " .
when we know what equipment we are going to , tom wei needs to revise the and in destination referred .
my successor should whole package once more with michelle chan in final .
someone needs with ebs legal to get the t and c 's for media cast to michelle or to direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in the case of the exchanges on the t and c 's for bandwidth trading referred .
( d ) overall change of responsibility regulatory hk michael , or whomever taking over these responsibilities , get from michelle chan of clifford a fresh of alison lindsay 's letter to xi xi of october 2000 stating that we received our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements .
- to be selecting an independent auditor to certify certain routine reports file .
once kim and chang starts this , someone from regulatory should be made available guide kim and chang on our regulatory , in robbi rossi .
the key e - mails are ( a ) one from me outlining the overall problem and some dealing with it ; ( b ) one from jan haizmann and in some cases alternative how to deal with it , ( c ) two from jae moo lee in korea with points of view .
art also responds to donald and roger estrada and relies on them for .
art has amendment to our special type 2 license to add service to other destinations .
someone needs to be assigned responsibility the amendment through .
i admit that i agree with we are taking for now and can nothing the immediate term .
if we are going japan one of the centerpieces of our asia ebs strategy , i to consider devoting more full time ebs regulatory resources to japan exclusively .
the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply have on immediate license amendment and operational that drive out time effectively term issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications business law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly .
seem to reduce long term risks to our business strategy .
" i had been giving intermittent support to scott yeager and justin cornett of ebs , reed of technology for all , figure the concept of technology for all to asia .
the strategy was to some of japan 's $ 15 billion pledge of funds to support digital divide activities - to support into asia of the ebs - supported tfa model .

this agency , which so far exists just on paper , used to build power plants run a state - owned transmission system .
with the state locking up so much of california 's power needs , legislators openly wonder whether utility - rescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they would require .
he credits the long - term power contracts with cool the spot market for electricity , where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply .
that was down from $ 243 in , though still far above the $ 25-to-$27 two years ago .
but some worry about how this rush to address a short - term problem the longer - term future .
the state has since hastily assembled a group of about 20 energy traders , headed by a 30-year - old one year in the energy business .
they managed lower current power costs , he , although that required signing deals force the state to " pay a little more " than it otherwise would have in the years ahead .
backers of the measure say it gives adequate review without unduly slowing the bond offering . '

folks , this note is intended all who concerned on our a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line .
it is our objective derivative products these entities to effectively hedge this exposure .
but it to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional .
thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities regional products and the pro - hurricane entities bundled regional products on their exposure .
the data sorted , storm , or the u.s coastline .
as on the modeling front , the certainly to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc .

because networks does all of enron , she has a in her role to transfer dollars between networks and various other companies .
at this time , the the asset accountants is by business unit and an accountant only perform an intercompany transfer within her business unit .
approve security role for the individuals who to intercompany transfers across .
manage the security so that the individual can not create master data outside of her own companies have to rely on the other company 's accountant to set it up for the transfer .

plan to meet in floor conference room at 9:00 am , wednesday , 3/27/02 , time keeping process .
, the city council has formed a committee to study of shielding temecula residents from similar jolts when the deregulation wave washes into riverside county in a couple of years .
we now know what happen , and we do n't to be caught asleep .
those cities are studying the of palm springs , which in 1997 contracted with portland gas and electric to provide residents with a flat rate for electricity for five years .
naggar said the council has yet to form a committee charged with monitoring san diego gas&electric 's proposal to string lines across huge metal towers through southwest county , to relieve san diego 's electric rate explosion .
if they decide to go down the middle of temecula , i can we 'll make a move .
if they decide to go through the ( santa rosa ) plateau , i assure 'll .
temecula council members have been unanimously opposed to bringing new power lines through , or near , the city since was unveiled about two months ago .
he said he 'll get back if we a meeting with rupert .
in to those answers , mind that market value can not necessarily be calculated with precision .
in the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of months , it is clear that , if $ .10 or $ .11 were deducted from the index price , then the resulting price would in the as published by inside ferc .

o iep?s internal polling shows rosenfield?s proposal has weaknesses be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a state - run energy department be compared to the dmv and caltrans .
o rosenfield would have a funding a campaign , especially raising the resources a strong , well funded " no " campaign .
voters are concerned about giving to things worse .
using this outline as a starting point an effective campaign plan successfully defeat rosenfield if he pursues an initiative strategy .
rosenfield submit a measure to the attorney general as late as september , 2001 and still qualify the initiative for the november 2002 ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power blackouts , skyrocketing energy bills , and the image of a bungling governor , legislature and regulators .
o paid signature gathering firms put on contract for industry - related business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for rosenfield .
an added the concept is defining the proposal early if it still qualifies for the ballot .
initially we believe the " no " campaign on following messages : o the measure hurt taxpayers .
this research would also be important in efforts to secure the most ballot title and summary of defeating it .
our shows that the ballot title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as 10 points .
a focused earned media campaign would enhance the chances for success and editorial op - ed?s important third party credibility to the no campaign .
campaign costs how to defeat rosenfield on several factors .
the more they it on the natural , the more expensive it will defeat the measure .
thorough research of rosenfield?s actual proposal will us to a campaign plan , message and budget .

the company also is building a $ 624 million natural gas pipeline into southern california mexico in a with pipeline operator kinder morgan energy partners , a dramatically ease california 's natural gas shortage .
a second the project , to cost $ 1.1 billion , would line into northern california .
a consulting firm at first , calpine in 1989 bought its first generator , a tiny geothermal plant in sonoma county , and proceeded other small thermal plants throughout northern california .
about that time calpine was making another decision about its .
the plant finally won the backing of the city council in , but only after state officials indicated they would ok regardless of the city 's objections .
cartwright noted that the project won of the sierra club , which argued that , cleaner - burning plants replace older , dirtier generators .

two large power plants supply californians with electricity will boost emissions in mexicali and imperial county , a cross - border region already plagued by air quality problems .
we 're not opposed to power plants , are concerned about the emission levels and the impact it on the health of the citizens of the two areas and the region 's economic , " said steve birdsall , a district pollution control officer .
we believe , " he said .
joel epstein , an intergen consultant , said the company 's research indicates the emissions wo n't have a side of the border .
epstein would n't reveal details of the initiative but said it " will both emissions profile as well as overall quality of the imperial valley region sides of the border .
because of the two plants ' total emission levels , the report says they will have " a far greater on u.s. and mexican citizens living in the border region than if these plants were constructed a miles to the north in the united states .
both plants have building and environmental permits from the mexican government and are construction about a mile apart in colonia progreso on mexicali 's western edge .
together , the plants enough electricity to power about 600,000 homes in california .
the study also did n't include data for two other power plants in the mexicali area .

john woolfolk mercury news california 's first major power plant than a decade pumping badly needed electricity into the grid today , leading a wave of generators to ease the state 's energy drought .
` ` it 's very encouraging for us as the operator of the state 's grid of this magnitude come shortfalls expected this summer , ' ' said jim detmers , vice president of grid operations at the iso .
edison plans to upgrade the plant to a , combined - cycle generating 585 megawatts by the summer of 2003 .
before taking action , however , the utilities plan more tests , and are awaiting from gov. gray davis , announcement week , the mercury news has learned .
they also must address the concerns of customers , who the concept and worried damage appliances or computers .
in several weeks and continue into the summer as workers adjust substations statewide , turning down voltages like motorists slightly lifting their foot from the to save fuel .
for now , supporters say , the idea is one of the more promising get california through the summer .
` ` like a deal to me . '
most appliances are built to operate best at about 115 volts , from 110 to 130 .
` ` the utilities agreed to test results from the past several weeks and use them to determine on a circuit - by - circuit basis where voltage conservation occur , and then implement that conservation wherever practical , ' ' nelson said .
the puc debate granting utilities an emergency waiver from the standards that would allow some homes -- particularly in outlying areas at the end of long circuits where voltage tends to drop off slightly -- to receive power as low as 110 volts temporarily , he said .
` ` as long as we keep the voltages above 114 , do that .
` ` we for every squeeze more megawatts from the system . ' '
the tests showed that small voltage would not damage the appliances ` ` give the governor the equivalent of a new power plant or two so he play poker better power suppliers , ' ' wattenburg said earlier this month .
` ` we 're they are into creative solutions .
we it have an official position in a . ' '
now , with the state buying electricity on behalf of utilities , take a blow .
participants stated that the legislature continues on a direct access solution not interfere with the bond sale and should be allowed to continue its unimpeded as the bonds to do have to be sold until september .
we are concerned that direct access suspended for 's sake - to job of taking the bonds to market .
but this issue is too the long - term solution to california 's energy problems for it to be so summarily dismissed .

i thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as i was thinking of the issues / positions .
, i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation on a response to cms , but i thought it made some sense what one might paper .
as noted below , there are underlying .
while many of computations are done on a basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only would 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( d ) for " year 35 " would the last 21 months of the contract term .
my overall concern is that an arbitrator focus on the anomaly ( described above ) that results by applying exhibit d using a concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around ..
more before a conclusion on the issue made , we likely to review or undertake , as the case , such as ( which i assume generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( be particularly settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp would concede the issue on a prospective basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that .
( discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to there that respect ) .

, the newly released may revision to the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over the eighteen months due to the weak sector and stock market .
the revision commences what is to a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are likely to grow in the coming months .
moody 's that the state 's ending cash position approximately $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash that borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are likely to depleted by the time long - term financing can be secured .
of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the long - term financing , as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds power purchases , and require dwr to seek rate increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income will also temper growth in sales tax collections for year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education , lead to prolonged budget debate in the .
while such budget negotiations not necessarily the timing of the issuance of the long - term power bonds , delay weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis will have economic , as well as financial , consequences that further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
the drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the sector , as well as the important housing sector .
in moody 's view , the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate of to quantify dimensions of the energy crisis .
at the moment , that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during of the last decade , with the planned long - term energy financing will it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that call for the rating to fall to the a range .
while that the state will a viable long - term energy financing over the months , substantial obstacles must to meet that goal .

according to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the bank of italy in rome , clementi said the documentation recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be to avert wider shocks in financial markets .
but these same customers take on exposure to other forms of credit through instruments without increasing their borrowing .
he is also worried about how courts countries would treat these contracts .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and push them onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books spark strong pressure listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
bis also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to - term instruments , particularly in the us .
trading rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury notes and bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued of the swaps market also underpinned demand for money market products , typically the most common hedging swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings of banks , these problems , one , will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions .
responses to a request for comment related to basel accord and an alternative proposal by the fed capital standards for u.s. banks show that most banks basel accord , he said .
i should emphasize that we are still analyzing your many comments to determine what kind of response give .
the of creating a single ' master master ' agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed , with advocates citing such contracts would efficiency by simplifying the negotiation market operators .
doubts were expressed by some participants , however , regarding a ' master master ' contract , especially concerning administration , legal and negotiation cross - affiliate master agreements .
few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an response , and the gains by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government will lead to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of likely behaviour include the us bond market association 's move last september proposals for a corporate bond futures contract , and cbot 's efforts mortgage - backed contracts .

stacey , based on jeremy 's responses below , alternative interest rate keep the usd without system .
let 's assume the following : postid currency - usd postid otc int type crv - alternative arg curve deal currency - usd deal level interest curve - alternative arg curve results : the portcalc using the alternative arg interest rate .
with an output currency code of " usd " , and your deals are booked in tagg to " aa int " for int ( ) , then portcalc the interest rate you specify in your postid .
these 2 books do satisfy the above requirements , so specify an alternate in your postid , portcalc will pv with that curve .
due to the high probability that the argentine peso and the usd will not continue to be linked 1 to 1 , to begin valuing the portfolios using an argentina interest rate curve .
and i recall that you thought it would require system .
at this time to to specify usd but pv at an alternative .
i though about was possibly adding a new currency called argusd and having it use the alternative interest rate curve .

and i detailed directions .
those that showed up yesterday .
on special , he cited the departure of kris stockton , who handled all the kicking duties last , and said a kicking game a key to having a succesfful season .
tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed promise for .
he and most of the other defensive tackles are smaller and than hampton and rogers , front four show a lot of improvement in pass rushing .
the tackles this year wo n't be as against the run as hampton and rogers , who were run - stoppers deluxe , but they , and , lets face it , the best teams on the ut regular - season schedule are geared to passing .
but let 's some of the walk - on kickers the ut staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced kick field goals .
if they ca n't , and if this team is as as it has a be , brown himself in the same boat as florida state coach bobby bowden , who lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he did n't have guys make a chip - shot field goal when the game was on the line .
i 'll report on them in depth in my newsletter .
they are supposed to be , and they will be .
brown said the longhorns will this year and that the team .
so , instead of picking the southern and northern divisions , i 'm going to pick the way i the big 12 up , from top to bottom , as a single entity .
brown says he is n't going to get caught up in pre - hype this year because it does n't make sense to to how a do when it has n't even started practicing .
the doctors told me i could again in three or four weeks
and , if i miss any games , it should n't than the first one or two .
the longhorns were already thin at defensive end , and critically short if mcclintock is out for a period of time .
he did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end ( from linebacker ) in the spring and is a guy we hopes for this season .
he said he go to a school where he has a log some playing time .
if the injury does cost mcclintock significant playing time , the coaches some moves to depth .
incoming freshman eric hall , who had been ticketed forfullback , a candidate for a switch to defensive end .
but we 've got to do a day to day and week to week .
if benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge quickly , i he 'll play and play a lot early in the season .
we were just you are back and to go to georgetown .

i at length at intrastate pipeline association meeting on june 22 ( to be hosted by redmond at enron's / hpl 's offices ) .
if passes , you will have one year to a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( verp ) .
note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp - that as though get facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , to apply for a verp gone on september 1 .
i am not certain to exist .
, i 've appended some information on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines that are trying to get a verp now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines that information is necessary or to take final action on the application , the commission the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the owner or operator of a grandfathered facility apply for a permit to operate the facility under this section .
the commission issue an existing facility flexible some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site .
the commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate be required than in other areas , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is , it is doubtful if significant control achieved through the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc to of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the verp program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram will not subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram permittable under a verp if there is test data to old ( pre - modification ) ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved .
also needed a representation of the cost of the controls and even though modifications are , the cost is prohibitive .
i all of this is .
if .
, you asked for an example of what we would consider " emission reductions " that acceptable in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level not be achieved .
also needed in the case - by - case review a representation of what the cost of the controls with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level could not be achieved .
be due limitations such as no controls or modifications are , or identify cost in dollars per nox controlled to show that even though additional modifications , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , .
at that time older rich burn engines been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .
the 10 year old bact review on these engines and turbines to on a case - by - case basis just would have done 10 years ago .
we this your members to decide which engines they either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december 7 , 2000 .
for each engine or turbine , please submit a , table 29 or 31 as applicable , and other information support the standard exemption claim .
for engines authorized by a verp permit , identify each engine by unit number , epn , air quality account number , and plant name , of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the verp program .
when the verp applications are submitted , information provided to show that nox emissions in the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr .
information showing that actual emissions reductions achieved , even when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g / hp - hr can not be met , staff review of the application .

i am still waiting for the files with the actual data , and i them as .
a controversial issue in these proceedings has been whether the costs of transco 's twelve incrementally - priced and southern projects rolled into transco 's system - wide rates .
the 1999 policy statement , however , has a threshold requirement for requiring that there no subsidization customers - in other words , no increase in costs of any kind .
the pgt order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs increase for existing shippers ; therefore , pgt had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that apply absent the new compression .

recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he would n't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups .
i to get your take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements , one that is almost the other one .
the wspp should be focusing on more boondoggles and more like for rto west , dealing with the emerging california changes , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy would let our marketers praise the wspp for being a organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to .
rosman should say : enron loves the wspp , it has done a with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now should to tasks .

the ferc to the oasis 2 is to continue and under whose leadership .
week ( tuesday ) i to review all the interconnected issues so that to espa jose resolution on the role of nerc market interface or commercial practice standards
whereas , reliability standards developed by nerc , relying on the expertise of industry experts , have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk in north america for over 30 years ; and whereas , with the opening of the transmission systems , the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities , and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers , nerc has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair , open , balanced and inclusive ; and whereas , to support the competitive electricity markets , the formation of large rtos , and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids , it is vitally to standardize mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards ; and whereas
, nerc has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards , including spearheading the oasis " what " and " how " that standards and communications protocols followed by all transmission providers ; formed a market committee as a new standing committee of nerc to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability ; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the electronic scheduling collaborative ( esc ) , which recently filed with ferc a report on their efforts common business practice standards for electronic scheduling ( oasis 2 ) ; and whereas , the electric business practice standards being by the electronic scheduling ( esc ) are a complement to nerc reliability on which nerc 's organization standards based ; and whereas , nerc is recognized and respected as the industry 's developer of standards for the reliable and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout north america , and whereas , the board of trustees recognizes the urgent for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards ; and whereas , the nerc stakeholders committee a strong preference for a single organization both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards ; be it therefore resolved , that nerc : 1 .
interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues affect wholesale electric operations .
the results of activities to date regarding reliability organization standards development process .
urge ferc use of the esc , use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the nerc board , development of wholesale electric business practice standards , including standards necessary for certain aspects of rto such as congestion management and ancillary services .
commit to continuing to support of the esc until such time as an industry consensus is achieved wholesale electric business practice standards within the nerc framework .
i to put some fire under this issue , as the " new sector weighted voting " seems to be yet to preserve the power of the traditional utility .
however , i do n't compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot .

ifr - november 17 , 2001 standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company should serve as reference entity default swaps in of a demerger or other structural change , such as a consolidation , will be put by the international derivatives association this week .
while the successor issue has been debated since the break - up of national power of the uk , the imminent break - ups of at&t and bt into smaller entities has underscored the for documentation .
it came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active new dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit us corporate default swaps .
definition was agreed at the end of april and released in , but liquidity in the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate .
the issue of obligation acceleration had not been a concern for dealers until moody 's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a " soft " credit event in the default swaps that back credit - linked collateralised debt obligations .
trigger exercise on a default swap , when there was still a the covenant made whole before the fundamental default event - failure a debt payment - had taken place .
derivatives dealing heads echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of will still be request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap .
the international derivatives association last week fpml.org , a non - profit industry body dedicated to developing a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions .
in theory , liquidity should a boost from a move to greater .
for smaller end users it means that there is less involved in entering into a transaction , " said lynn .
no decision on linking fpml 's transaction standards with isda has been made yet , but such a move is likely in .
joining forces raise of fpml , but awareness of its is not a problem said lynn .
fpml.org 's architectural group , and its covering rate , foreign exchange and equity derivatives , will continue to exist as sub - groups 's new fpml committee .
isda 's fpml committee will retain responsibility for approving of the standard .
fpml standards currently exist for rate derivative products and rate agreements .

sme lenders ' initial concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that expected loss provisions made in typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral used as a risk mitigant .
the basel committee has since issued a paper , ' modifications to the committee 's proposals ' , which outlines current thinking within the committee and indicates that it key concessions to sme lenders .
we have got maturities , this would put german banks at an enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries , " says winkler .
what kills a bank is deterioration of value , and it to a lot of things on the books , so you ca n't wait default , " said a basel committee member .

asked if the us agree such a concession , he added , " i could n't say that , but it depend on the whole package .
another area of compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment , while banks with loans of more than three years capped at the three - year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach .
how big the rate effect smes ?
the paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and added to the irb risk - weight methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and probability of default .
retail businesses and wholesale businesses have similar turnover , but the characteristics and the would manage them in risk terms quite different , " says colin jennings , senior manager , non - retail related risk at lloyds tsb , the uk 's third largest bank .
the committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected losses to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , so we much against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .

s&p that enron can raise enough capital to that hole , provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company .
that innovative operation was getting off the ground , but the desk has n't to transact for three weeks , since the value of enron 's stock and bonds began to plummet , according to another enron employee .
enron did n't respond to a request for comment , but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are " constrained " as the market continues the company 's credit position .
the company is so energy market participants that they desperately enron to survive .

while progress is being made in addressing in legal documentation practices , it has proven difficult to achieve the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers to the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
the banks said they feared the legislation discourage international investors from trading in hong shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they to do so under law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
netting provisions to include a wider otc products has been a priority for the international swaps and derivatives association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - profile reports in 1999 by the president 's group - one - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that netting law would reduce systemic risk .
the definition of swaps has been stretched to cover rate agreements , foreign exchange contracts and other instruments .
friction developed between the securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a allen & overy york and isda 's legal counsel .
have collateral and an array of products to for safe harbour " netting and settlement will faster and under the new bill , he adds .
the organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the u.s. district court for the southern district york .
the three groups contended that because a wide factors can affect the market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and information of all facts likely the market price so burdensome as to be unreasonable .
the narrow of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary account applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
the eurobond market was a response to a new withholding tax on payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds .
at of 2000 , outstanding otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of international debt securities .
there a limit to the efficiency gains that wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
either way , there always be for increasing efficiency in the financial system .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage derivatives , the scope for innovation is less obvious than to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist could assume that financial innovation at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , especially those concentrated in a particular hub , use weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather many more delays than they are used to , notes claudio ribeiro , head of development , weather risk management group , enron .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to be sufficiently fungible to build a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , control , at the new york exchange .
through the otc market , kind of structure , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather engine is needed replicate thousands of multi - regional weather , said rookley .
initial were that the treasury 's a fortnight ago would prompt the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus fuel credit derivative market growth .
on examination , those seem to be fading .
also , the assets for synthetic securitisation are relatively small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some smaller building societies candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations , others not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
the smaller building societies be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , not to build the infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring for credit derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies to be securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of these transactions is quite sizeable , other industry officials said .
a building society 's ability to use credit derivatives hinges on where it fits on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient in using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum will have to apply and a strong case for why it use credit derivatives .
building societies are most likely to use synthetic securitisations product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a or for transferring the risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
the changes building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk turn out to be what prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market .
theoretically , credit derivatives the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have to use only interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives .
it has been a quarter for the big us energy trading firms .
we continue generating capacity , which inventory of capacity low - cost , high - value in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford rogers & wells york , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of the documentation .
he adds : " very hard at upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market our california .
clifford 's yeres expects that i the california crisis will accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , set up of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees , or any type of mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers have added quite a bit language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood of time and been proven in court .
isda itself has an initiative under way that , , energy marketers operating in california .
it at master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is board member and chair of the energy products committee into this , says : " it would be a much world a way to isda master for both physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " , a party to a with " reasonable " grounds to be insecure about the ability of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities demand performance assurance such as collateral .
documentation , some energy traders [ have ] been terminate - out an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and costs of this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the california crisis are long remembered .
isma said these bodies needed to in a constructive way to a more harmonised security settlement environment in europe to " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .
the organisation 's intervention pressure on europe 's 26 different clearing and settlement systems up co - operation so costs can reduced .

june 7 through 20 bring fewer than 4 days with a maximum temperature over 80 and 2 or fewer days over 85 .
forecasts would indicate that it is unlikely that any stretches of heat will impact chicago through the end of june .

in order to minimize risk and the time required to a cash flow , the client company a multi phase strategic production plan
phase i show a profit within seven months of initial funding .
ii is somewhat larger than phase i employ its own proprietary technology and a separate facility location .
phase ii about twelve to fourteen month after funding and the will show a profit about two months after startup .
the recent dramatic rise in energy prices in the us has caused some generators of the spent solvents be the feedstock for this facility to these streams for fuel .
a reevaluation of this situation is underway at the present time and the decision as to of this will be made in late first quarter of 2001 .
, although much more capital intensive than phase ii , has been separated from iv for several reasons : 1 .
in contrast to this , the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated solvents , iv , will require between ten and eighteen well .
the technology to be employed and the absence of corrosive compounds in the processes iii will allow the equipment and piping to be fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic alloys , be required for iv , chlorinated solvent reclamation process .
the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products for are much than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks iv .
iv a the us while phase v in the caribbean .
in addition the team includes another individual with in excess of 25 years of financial banking , investment banking and financial management .
from the point of the first financial draw approximately 6 to 7 months required to construct i plant , go through startup to commence full - scale production .
while this gas is not for sale as " pipeline " quality gas it is for the production of ammonia .
the client company believes that freight considerations alone sufficient cost differential to insure that it can successfully sell its 50,000 tons per year of product into the local market .
ii operation will face competition because we have only one dedicated facility that is doing similar to what the client .
this market is expected to grow about 2 % per .
in the loan amount , we have pre - funding cost ) asset value of the client company w / facilities technology - within 18 months of initial funding
number 1 & 2 , above , currently from uop and phillips petroleum , for example , for about a million dollars per year ( royalty or technology fee ) each .

when dan larcamp recently visited he commented that pipelines to take a gas and electric positions and practices .
here is a at that we are comparing : contracting for transportation / transmission capacity .
customers may fax pipeline staff to negotiate discounts , although sometimes a pipeline may post a generally discount on the website .
dan larcamp mentioned that he feels like electric form 1s .
i 'm not 're comparing apples and apples , as the electrics are still utilities and thus the form 1 includes sales data .
but , we 'll a comparison nonetheless .
hopefully , the detailed comparison be month .
also , fyi enron government affairs is on their comments to the latest oasis rulemaking to use the comparison suggest best pipeline website practices be a oasis .

after relevant commercial , legal and environmental project managers personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl immediately begin of the documents necessary to achieve the icc approval of any future transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative structure ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this recommendation is based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold to perc and enron as a site , viability and risk / reward profile of the commercial has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
the site ( in combination with the calumet project ) represents an integral component a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
the factors contributing to the perc and enron not to to 6/26/00 are listed :
the incomplete status of commercial associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while commercial associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a power site upon which perc and enron continue to conduct due development activities .
perc and risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other which protect their respective assets and economic viability of a on the torrence south parcel .
perc personnel have estimated that the icc require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to achieve icc approval ) .
this risk viability of an ' 01 in - service a torrence power llc .
perc and a binding agreement which specifies an approval and cost - sharing mechanism development decisions on the torrence south parcel .
such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing / selldown strategy currently under development by perc and enron for all of the chicago development .

although be the last ease this year , recent market moves that the fed has done enough to support a recovery in h2 .
it turns out that what they really were see was something a formal biological ( ba ) for cs 3 and cs 4 , not a biological survey report provided .
he said that only were going to findings of " affect " they maybe the get concurrence from the usfws .
mark , i am report that everyone has extremely hard to collect all of the information that has ( and then some ) for purposes of due diligence .
while current awano and seguchi we touched upon reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
enron to review and the assumptions we have utilized i still share some fundamental numbers in order to put this value into .
in other words , if we were to flip at it worth at least this much .
looked at another way , discounting the npv back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current npv of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current share !
hard to believe that your due diligence will bear them out .
just these two placing a ridiculously low 20 % on them with the $ 3 per share of cash on our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many are on .
if enron , with all of its significant resources , were to fully support on these two believe that of their quite high .
( we have been receiving support from the global lng group by the way )
this is also why i that we focus our immediate attention on these two perhaps the oita .
i that agree that reaching a conclusion as is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to be that the current infighting between and e power has limited enron 's ability to recognize 1 ) the quality and significant capabilities of the employees of e power and 2 ) the that has through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of greenfield sites as well as the respect to brownfield developments .
within six to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive development sites leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .
we continue to a way our mutual energies on building value in market rather than on non - bickering and turf wars .

some industry insiders these higher prices will spread to other deregulated states in .
, the high summer temperatures meant utilities ate into their existing reserves to generate more electricity .
the cost to go into a and market to is so high while the return on residential customers is so low that the pursuit of residential customers just may not it for non - incumbent utilities .
a fully deregulated large numbers of residential and small business customers participating ... remains at least a couple of years away .
you have to offer a discount and by the time you offer a discount , then the spread between the actual price and the wholesale price is too .
the state has imposed rate caps ensure that residential customers ca n't be harmed by volatile prices .
while consumer groups complain about high rates and some industry insiders a darker residential customers , other experts saythe current situation is just a matter of a newly deregulated industry experiencing growing pains .
competition should live up to its promise of lower rates , but residential customers to resign themselves to the fact that larger - volume users greater savings from deregulation than they will .

i had a call with trena mcfarland today picking up on earlier discussions with respect to for the softs business to be conducted out of london and new ( e : mail of 2/2/01 for detailed discussion of the alternatives ) .
trena said that there was a strong legal preference to use ena rather than a new us corporation for the trading activity conducted out of new york , and that ectric ( or llc ) through eeft the principal for uk trading activity .
as a result of this trena is considering establishing parallel books such that , for example , the london based traders offer prices on nybot look - alike and the nybot / liffe spread trades as well as offering prices on the liffe - alike trades .
the this route is that there is the possibility of arbitrage since the have overlapping hours of trading .
the possibility of arbitrage restricted to those counterparties which are registered both with london and eol and are thus see both prices with a bit of collusion - this most likely in the case of a global counterparty which is operating through one or more branches .

an industry comment period global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but will just for banks calculating how the sweeping affect their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision rules worries an industry stalemate adoption of the badly - rules in jurisdictions .
banks complain basel 2 's calibration formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that lead mid - banks using the standardised approach to wind up with a disproportionately exposure to riskier borrowers .
supervisors are expected to the kinks , however , and are expected to take into account data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative impact study ( www.bis.org ) .
but now as though it changed .
the basel committee finish analysing these , and is them into the version of basel 2 .

by kathleen dubbed virtual portfolios , risk measurement services that include a ' what - if ' scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' enhancement , released to clients in mid - , includes features to determine value at risk ( var ) , tracking error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .

the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools will risk manager in deciphering what positions are needed to get back within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
the for more reliable scenario hedging for managers investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for ' what - if ' scenario analysis lately .
he also credits the more educated investor who prompting the fund manager to install risk management and reporting systems , particularly based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , for start - up funds .
