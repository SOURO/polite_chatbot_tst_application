new york -(dow jones)- banks [P_91] prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to [P_96] markets , as they [P_98] to the changing requirements of the basel accord on capital requirements , a federal reserve study says .
specifically , the report cites exposure to derivatives as one area where broader and more tightly [P_95] models of credit risk are [P_97] to be a future requirement for banks .
[P_90] york federal reserve study , entitled " using credit risk [P_94] regulatory capital : issues and options , " is [P_97] publication in a forthcoming economic policy review .
when questioned , hirtle said the study 's reference to derivatives and to the possible [P_95] for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk [P_99] was n't based on specific [P_911] problems in the financial sector .
for positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise [P_92] to a material extent on market [P_95] , standards likely would require [P_97] models of market movements and credit exposures , " the report said .
she also gave an example in [P_92] of how a chain of events might lower the worth of a credit for a bank .
[P_90] to the basel accord , planned for introduction by 2004 , aim [P_95] the way that banks globally [P_97] for risk .
nobuaki kurisu , chief fund manager at sumisei global investment trust management , also cited derivatives -related selling as a factor in the stock market 's plunge , and added that such selling [P_911] market volatility high for the time being , making institutional investors [P_915] to buy .
the rush to hedge equity linked derivative bonds , which usually [P_93] in six months to one year , offer higher [P_97] rates than ordinary bonds if the nikkei stays above a pre - determined level .
but once the nikkei drops below that level , the return at the bond 's maturity [P_95] lower than [P_96] investment .
it is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who can file under chapter 13 and who [P_97] file under chapter 7 .
the bill now must wait until the senate passes its version before a conference [P_94] appointed [P_95] out differences between the two bills ( see related report in this section ) .
bonds that had previously [P_91] at a 60 handle [P_93] suddenly be tendered at par .
important insurance credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several [P_93] events - the declaration of a bankruptcy ; the failure to pay interest on a loan or bond , or the restructuring , repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers [P_914] creditworthiness of a counterparty - the buyer of [P_917] deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity , and receive back par value in return .
because of the product , loan portfolio managers [P_92] sides of the atlantic have morphed in recent years into active traders , while insurance company and hedge fund managers gained a [P_910] way to position themselves .
nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy if there 's a glimmer of [P_94] a company may turn around [P_97] .
since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract , bofa certainly could have considered it a repaid loan , and then extended a [P_99] loan if it had [P_910] couch it in such terms , " says one dealer .
that path would have avoided [P_91] default .
the credit [P_90] has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products , and although it has n't yet reached a critical stage , participants are concerned that this bifurcation may [P_910] hurt overall market liquidity .
for example , would a bank give up its collection rights on a $ 20 million credit default swap if it had $ 1 billion in total loans that [P_99] thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration ?
the conseco situation showed how a [P_92] default [P_92] trigger a credit derivatives exercise , but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt .
we have to establish a better standard for interdealer business , or risk less liquidity and a [P_95] of added basis risk within dealer books .
although achieving consensus will not [P_91] , kennaugh 's [P_93] is that some standard acceptable to investors , hedgers and dealers alike [P_97] established .
the language to accomplish [P_91] require some [P_92] drafting , but the goal [P_94] give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that [P_98] not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longer - dated paper , while [P_914] of [P_915] swaps would still maintain the regulatory [P_918] tender restructured paper .
this compromise , however , [P_91] a " two - step delivery option .
on [P_90] of a loan restructuring , the holder of a credit default swap [P_95] either tender the actual loan affected or a similar short - term piece of debt , or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy [P_916] at a [P_917] .
in other words , [P_91] be one central contract , but with a new delivery twist within it .
it [P_90] introduce too much uncertainty into the delivery process .
given the large [P_91] of [P_91] underlying credits , however , the specific drafting required here [P_95] even more difficult for participants to agree on [P_98] .
such an approach [P_91] result [P_91] mismatches and basis risk on dealer books , but [P_95] diverse end - user participants more satisfied .
people [P_90] what contracts they [P_92] trade , and [P_93] have to wait [P_95] which contract [P_96] be .
if banks still [P_91] relief with restructuring included , that price exists today and will continue to exist .
it 's easy to imagine yet another [P_92] xerox may technically fall into default on certain obligations , but continue to pay [P_97] on other paper .
lawsuits have n't sprung from the conseco situation , but [P_93] for xerox since there is more money on the table .
[P_90] credit problems flare up [P_92] , [P_92] come under even more scrutiny , with conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market .
it has been approved by ben and chris booth and should [P_93] to sandridge [P_95] today .

[P_90] achieves the two main objectives of the ppi [P_93] : it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the [P_911] coefficients .
[P_90] the response of [P_91] to wildly - varying rpi [P_94] , a sine wave of period 3 years for rpi was [P_98] into the ppi [P_99] .
this shows that [P_91] had [P_92] in our rpi forward [P_94] , then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately .
[P_90] model is plotted [P_91] burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue .
dear all , [P_91] it [P_92] brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18.80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent [P_917] curve produced by the global products group is used ) .
[P_90] , the two equations differ in the [P_93] - term and very long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3.0 % to 3.2 % over [P_913] six months .
this is only [P_91] the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 ( which we do n't ) .
[P_90] now is a differently - specified model designed to forecast only [P_95] 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive error terms .

[P_90] my friend nicholas bollini for [P_92] on this one .
delegates at the bonn climate change negotiations are expected [P_93] through saturday [P_94] decisions [P_95] " [P_96] and give full effect " to the agreement .
[P_90] , developed countries [P_91] the u.s. on board and this leaves room for the bush administration [P_95] an alternative -- though the [P_98] close [P_99] .
however , [P_90] have a role in complying with emissions reduction obligations .
it is too early to tell [P_92] impact competitiveness or whether they will be interpreted as non - tariff trade barriers .
[P_90] , only parties to the protocol can [P_92] the market - based [P_94] under the protocol ( emissions trading , [P_97] - mechanisms in [P_98] through the clean development mechanism , [P_911] based mechanisms in other developed countries through joint implementation ) .
because the details are not yet [P_92] , it is unclear whether enron [P_94] to participate in mechanisms or [P_97] offices in other countries outside the u.s.
[P_90] be important that the u.s. [P_92] linkages with the market - based mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations .
this could [P_90] more costly and burdensome reductions in [P_93] for u.s. firms ( as the u.s. [P_96] a more stringent target to meet ) .

jeff johnson and his team are putting [P_92] a plan that will address most of [P_95] and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go [P_98] bidweek and [P_910] close for august .
the [P_90] tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become [P_95] hogs as the amount of data grows .
[P_90] and hopefully migrate to the [P_92] of sybase which will address some of the issues .
[P_90] also require some hardware [P_92] to where we store certain data .
we [P_90] user [P_92] stress [P_93] prior [P_93] .
this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions [P_97] what if any action should be taken [P_910] transactions .

lousie seems [P_90] that you [P_92] the u.s. version of this .
vince , i [P_91] a lot of material to " [P_93] the wholes " [P_95] reaction to the current draft .
[P_90] a [P_91] day and tremendous [P_93] the [P_94] .
those should [P_90] be part of a class on risk management .
the last of the warm air [P_92] scoured out of the east today with near to [P_95] for most of the country [P_98] .
a [P_90] southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winter storms [P_94] weekend .
imagine [P_90] if only there was more cold air in [P_93] .
the current storm [P_91] drive out most of [P_93] moisture , but some lake effect is [P_96] some light snow amounts should occur .
however , the set up [P_91] favorable for some sort of low pressure [P_94] in the vicinity of the gulf coast [P_97] week .
[P_90] head toward the se us [P_92] factor .
it has had it for three runs in a row , but given the high surface pressures does not [P_96] as cold as i [P_98] have expected .
i [P_90] most areas to run [P_92] or slightly [P_93] .
we [P_90] going to [P_91] accounting memo [P_93] .
finally , there are some conceptual points that i believe [P_93] discussed w/ relation to the unique structure for " softs " trading we have been planning .
i have [P_90] up the numbers and decide whether i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i have [P_90] up the numbers and decide > whether > i 'm going to fill potholes out on rt .
i am leaving with regret , as i [P_92] all of you , and i believe ebs is poised for [P_97] .
[P_90] in a [P_91] , i [P_92] this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am working on , and [P_99] about [P_910] .
again , many , [P_91] and for what i have learned about broadband and ebs from each of you .
[P_90] not [P_91] on the application until we decide what legal entity to use .
this is a [P_91] option in my opinion as the regulator ( ida ) does not [P_95] at cross purposes with other parts of the government that [P_910] to [P_910] ebs with incentives .
for example it [P_91] that jan haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee ( done offshore for example ) .
jan i believe [P_91] on this that he adanced in the context of korea .
i believe it would still be prudent [P_92] had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore ( as we have in [P_98] and japan ) for the purpose of guiding us [P_912] sorts of [P_913] ( or at least confirming our reading ) and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working group headed by wayne gardner .
the contacts i [P_91] with are andy haire and [P_94] yeo
i was to have gone to adl singapore [P_92] for a meeting to question them [P_95] much of this they [P_97] to do independently without reliance on us .
so , to be awarded pioneer status , which the edb is very willing to consider [P_95] after many months of persuasion , i believe [P_98] edb demonstrate what the quantitative spin - off benefits are for singapore from our [P_914] bandwidth trading here ( e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization , effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment ) .
the idea is to get adl to perform the quantitative economic development analysis [P_94] not do in - house .
( d ) direct [P_91] edb on ebs 's plans edb ( chelsia lim ) has this week asked ebs [P_97] her on its [P_98] for singapore .

o iep?s internal polling shows rosenfield?s proposal has weaknesses [P_93] be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a state - run energy department [P_99] be compared to the dmv and caltrans .
o rosenfield would have a [P_91] funding a campaign , especially raising the resources [P_95] a strong , well funded " no " campaign .
voters are concerned about giving [P_91] to [P_92] things worse .
[P_90] using this outline as a starting point [P_93] an effective campaign plan [P_95] successfully defeat rosenfield if he pursues an initiative strategy .
[P_90] rosenfield [P_91] submit a measure to the attorney general as late as september , 2001 and still qualify the initiative for the november 2002 ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power blackouts , skyrocketing energy bills , and the image of a bungling governor , legislature and regulators .
o paid signature gathering firms [P_91] put on contract for industry - related business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for rosenfield .
an added [P_90] the concept is defining the proposal early if it still qualifies for the ballot .
initially we believe the " no " campaign [P_92] on [P_93] following messages : o the measure [P_97] hurt taxpayers .
this research would also be important in efforts to secure the most [P_94] ballot title and summary [P_95] of defeating it .
our [P_90] shows that the ballot title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as 10 points .
a focused earned media campaign would [P_92] enhance the chances for success and editorial [P_94] op - ed?s [P_96] important third party credibility to the no campaign .
campaign costs how [P_91] to defeat rosenfield [P_93] on several factors .
the more they [P_91] it on the natural , the more expensive it will [P_94] defeat the measure .
thorough research of rosenfield?s actual proposal will [P_92] us to [P_93] a campaign plan , message and budget .

our customers [P_90] today in lowering their energy costs and today 's proposal [P_94] $ 16 million [P_97] encourage energy conservation in our region , " said edwin a. guiles , president of sdg&e.

under the proposal filed friday , the low - income [P_93] funds [P_94] used [P_95] programs , such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements , while introducing new programs , including room air - conditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair .
[P_90] are still being developed , but they [P_93] in place in early september .
friday 's proposal marks the latest in a series of actions sdg&e has taken recently [P_95] customers grapple with high electric prices .
that proposal , [P_91] the deregulation - dividend checks most sdg&e customers [P_94] , will result in a total of about $ 500 million benefit to them in august and september -- nearly$300 for the typical residential customer -- [P_914] ease cash - flow problems from higher electricity prices .
those customers participating in the [P_91] see bills this summer that are comparable to last summer 's bills .
sdg&e also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding [P_94] in the energy marketplace , [P_96] energy - efficiency funding and conservation [P_98] for reducing electric bills .

as part of its effort to tackle california 's energy woes , ferc staff has been studying the state 's pipeline infrastructure [P_97] if there are ways [P_99] the delivery of gas .
the acc is becoming increasingly concerned with the pipeline capacity situation in arizona and whether current natural gas shippers in arizona , with existing contract rights on the el paso system , [P_910] reliable pipeline service in [P_912] , " wrote the commission .
additionally , it appears that little or no [P_92] pipeline capacity [P_93] added by el paso in [P_96] serve existing cus - tomers and [P_99] contract rights , beyond the line 2000 [P_912] which will largely replace capacity that has been lost for other reasons .
el paso recently won [P_91] line 2000 , [P_93] boost deliverability into califor - nia by as much as 230 million cfd .
according to shippers in texas , arizona and new mexico , el paso has proposed a [P_95] allocation scheme that would force captive shippers to pay more for access to its system .
ferc , in fact , is [P_92] a [P_92] conference [P_93] the [P_95] by el paso 's latest allocation plan .
the concerns of the acc [P_91] shore up the assertions of east - of - california shippers .
most importantly , said the acc , ferc should encourage capacity [P_93] that serve the needs of both existing shippers and [P_97] shippers .

third , owning the nine mile point plants will elevate constellation 's stature , moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in [P_99] york market , entergy corp.

although calpine has run into problems in some locations -- including san jose , where opposition arose to its proposed plant in the coyote valley -- it has generally found [P_910] sailing .
the company also is building a $ 624 million natural gas pipeline into southern california [P_95] mexico in a [P_96] with pipeline operator kinder morgan energy partners , a [P_910] dramatically ease california 's natural gas shortage .
a second [P_90] the project , to cost $ 1.1 billion , would [P_94] line into northern california .
a consulting firm at first , calpine in 1989 bought its first generator , a tiny geothermal plant in sonoma county , and proceeded [P_98] other small thermal plants throughout northern california .
about that time calpine was making another [P_92] decision about its [P_93] .
the plant finally won the backing of the city council in [P_93] , but only after state officials indicated they would ok [P_97] regardless of the city 's objections .

two large power plants [P_91] supply californians with electricity will [P_93] boost emissions in mexicali and imperial county , a cross - border region already plagued by air quality problems .
we 're not opposed to power plants , [P_92] are concerned about the emission levels and the impact it [P_96] on the health of the citizens of the two areas and [P_911] the region 's economic [P_914] , " said steve birdsall , a district pollution control officer .
we believe [P_90] , " he said .
joel epstein , an intergen consultant , said the company 's research indicates the emissions wo n't have a [P_96] side of the border .
epstein would n't reveal details of the initiative but said it " will both [P_94] emissions profile as well as [P_97] overall quality of the imperial valley region [P_910] sides of the border .
because of the two plants ' total emission levels , the report says they will have " a far greater [P_96] on u.s. and mexican citizens living in the border region than if these plants were constructed a [P_913] miles to the north in the united states .
both plants have building and environmental permits from the mexican government and are [P_94] construction about a mile apart in colonia progreso on mexicali 's western edge .
together , the plants [P_91] enough electricity to power about 600,000 homes in california .
the study also did n't include data for two other power plants [P_94] in the mexicali area .
i guess our learning curve here was that [P_92] of these facilities took longer [P_95] anticipated , but we 'll still have them in september .

mayor ron gonzales originally argued that the power plant was too close to a neighborhood and to workers at a huge office park that cisco systems [P_98] to build .
but that study , as well as an earlier analysis [P_93] by the grid operator , suggest that several billion dollars might lie beyond the reach of federal energy regulators .
california [P_90] to argue that neither of those factors should influence a settlement .
[P_90] we suffered [P_91] last summer .
wholesale power costs in california were $ 7 billion in 1999 , rose to $ 27 billion last year [P_96] top $ 50 billion this year , according to state estimates .
[P_90] long - term energy contracts may lock california into paying higher - than - market rates [P_96] electricity .
we have no idea what the price of power [P_93] week [P_94] month or [P_95] .

the plants , which [P_91] operating in two years , [P_93] electricity to 600,000 homes in california .
the report said the generators will have " a far greater [P_93] on u.s. and mexican citizens living in the border region than if these plants were constructed a few miles to the north in the united states .

john woolfolk mercury news california 's first major power plant [P_93] than a decade [P_95] pumping badly needed electricity into the grid today , leading a [P_99] wave of generators to ease the state 's energy drought .
` ` it 's very encouraging for us as the operator of the state 's grid [P_95] of this magnitude come [P_98] shortfalls expected this summer , ' ' said jim detmers , vice president of grid operations at the iso .
edison plans to upgrade the plant to a [P_92] , combined - cycle [P_94] generating 585 megawatts by the summer of 2003 .
before taking [P_90] action , however , the utilities plan more tests , and are awaiting [P_95] from gov. gray davis , [P_97] announcement [P_99] week , the mercury news has learned .
they also must address the concerns of customers , who [P_93] the concept and worried [P_96] damage appliances or computers .
[P_90] in [P_91] several weeks and continue into the summer as workers adjust substations statewide , turning down voltages like motorists slightly lifting their foot from the [P_910] to save fuel .

` ` [P_90] like a [P_92] deal to me . '
most appliances are built to operate best at about 115 volts , [P_94] from 110 to 130 .
` ` the utilities agreed to [P_92] test results from the past several weeks and use them to determine on a circuit - by - circuit basis where [P_99] voltage conservation [P_910] occur , and then implement that conservation wherever practical , ' ' nelson said .
the puc [P_90] debate granting utilities an emergency waiver from the standards that would allow some homes -- particularly in outlying areas at the end of long circuits where voltage tends to drop off slightly -- to receive power as low as 110 volts temporarily , he said .
` ` as long as we keep the voltages above 114 , [P_94] do that .
` ` we [P_91] for every [P_92] squeeze more megawatts from the system . ' '
the tests showed that small [P_91] voltage would not damage the appliances [P_94] ` ` give the governor the equivalent of a new power plant or two so he [P_910] play poker better [P_911] power suppliers , ' ' wattenburg said earlier this month .

while i [P_90] should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone , i nonetheless thought it [P_96] of some [P_97] set forth a few preliminary focal points for [P_911] , particularly if you do n't get to [P_914] a [P_915] .
i thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as i was thinking [P_94] of the issues / positions .
[P_90] , i did not know whether it was ena 's or dynegy 's obligation [P_95] on a response to cms , but i thought it made some sense [P_910] what one might [P_912] paper .
as noted below , there are [P_92] underlying [P_93] .
while many of [P_91] computations are done on a [P_93] basis -- which generally supports mplp 's position -- the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a [P_910] basis results in two anomalies : namely , the stated capacity charge ( on exhibit d ) for " year 1 " only would [P_919] 3 months , but even more importantly , the capacity charge ( [P_920] d ) for " year 35 " would [P_920] the last 21 months of the contract term .
my overall concern is that an arbitrator [P_92] focus on the anomaly ( described above ) that results by applying exhibit d using a [P_98] concept ( i.e. , the 21 month " year 35 " issue ) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around ..
more before a [P_91] conclusion on the issue [P_92] made , we likely [P_94] to review or undertake , as the case [P_98] , [P_99] such as ( which i assume [P_911] generally obtain from the michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e - [P_916] forwarded ) : --the michigan puc presumably approved the ppa ( prior to the first amendment ) in a published order .
( [P_90] be particularly [P_91] settle out the dispute on the basis that mplp would concede the issue on a prospective basis only ) .
certain points in support of mplp 's position --the definition of " contract capacity factor " provides for a [P_96] determination and , most importantly , provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the cod occurs that ends at the end of that [P_916] .
( [P_90] discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to [P_95] there [P_96] that respect ) .

[P_90] , the newly released may revision to the governor 's budget submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over the [P_98] eighteen months due to the weak [P_911] sector and stock market .
the [P_90] revision commences what is [P_92] to [P_92] a difficult budget debate .
to date , the state 's general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately $ 4 billion , and these advances are likely to grow [P_98] in the coming months .
moody 's [P_90] that the state 's ending cash position [P_93] approximately $ 10 billion at june 30 , 2001 , including both general fund cash and internal " borrowable resources " , which represents cash that [P_912] borrowed by the general fund beyond the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , the state 's cash reserves are likely to [P_94] depleted by the time long - term financing can be secured .
[P_90] of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity .
we are currently assuming the state 's general fund [P_93] not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the long - term financing , as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds [P_911] power purchases , and require dwr to seek [P_915] rate increases during 2001 .
based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector , which relies heavily on options in compensation packages , and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse [P_910] on capital gains , the state has reduced its tax revenue [P_914] year by approximately $ 5.4 billion , including a $ 2.7 downward [P_919] in the personal income tax .
the drop in these sources of income will also temper growth in sales tax collections for [P_95] year .
the proposed budgetary reductions , along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education , [P_95] lead to prolonged budget debate in the [P_98] .
while such budget negotiations [P_91] not necessarily [P_92] the timing of the issuance of the long - term power bonds , delay [P_97] weaken the state 's fiscal position .
the energy crisis will have economic , as well as financial , consequences that [P_94] further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook .
the drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the [P_93] sector , as well as the important housing sector .
in moody 's view , the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate [P_95] of [P_96] to quantify dimensions of the energy crisis .
at the moment , [P_91] that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the state of california during [P_96] of the last decade , [P_98] with the planned long - term energy financing will [P_912] it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that [P_915] call for the rating to fall to the a range .
while [P_90] that the state will [P_92] a viable long - term energy financing over the [P_96] months , substantial obstacles must [P_99] to meet that goal .
[P_90] call , i [P_91] the 8:30 a.m. conference [P_93] morning on the agency agreement .

for more than a year viacom has said it was waiting for a recovery in blockbuster 's stock -- long stalled below its offering price -- before it [P_99] with previously [P_910] to split off the remaining 82.3 % of the publicly traded unit .
blockbuster has been picking up market share and growing the business , " mr. karmazin said , adding that viacom was " [P_97] its future prospects .
viacom 's change of mind is likely to spark speculation that the [P_94] offer to buy the 17.7 % of blockbuster stock [P_98] that is in the public 's hands , [P_911] to tap the cash now being generated by the chain .
when viacom originally acquired the business in 1994 , it [P_93] it [P_94] be a cash cow that [P_96] pay for the paramount communications acquisition that year .
but instead , blockbuster turned into a problem child , as growth in the video market ground to a [P_96] halt and the unit spent most of its cash on building [P_910] stores .
blockbuster has [P_90] market share , reflecting fading competition from other chains and independent stores .
at the time viacom planned to unload within about a year of the ipo its remaining blockbuster holding by offering viacom shareholders a [P_97] exchange their shares for stock in the video - rental unit .
blockbuster stock rallied sharply in the first couple of months of this year , from around $ 8 at the end of last year to a [P_98] $ 15.10 in late february .
meanwhile , the specter that new electronic services [P_92] hurt blockbuster has faded .
business is so strong that blockbuster now is having to deal with a [P_94] problem : long check - out lines at stores , where in some cases customers have had to wait for 45 minutes .

u.s.-based enron corp on wednesday presented plans to [P_92] a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant [P_911] .

the plant , to [P_91] by e power corp - a wholly - owned unit of encom - [P_96] eventually [P_97] capacity to 3 - 4 million kilowatts if there is enough demand .

according to the plan , [P_91] plans to build a gas - turbine combined cycle power plant with [P_96] capacity of 2,000 megawatts in the mutsu ogawara industrial area in aomori in the northern part of japan 's main island .
construction is scheduled to [P_91] 2004 , following an environmental [P_93] from relevant authorities , for [P_96] in 2007 [P_97] .
building a large power plant that [P_92] environmentally - friendly in the mutsu ogawara area would [P_95] the economy and [P_97] the prefecture , " governor morio kimura said .

encom is considering other sites [P_91] on which it [P_93] build large - scale power plants .
however , comprehensive pricing and other [P_92] of the whole [P_93] are n't expected to be finalized for another [P_96] .
this is a state which has a reasonably sound record at [P_93] resources mobilisation , but is now facing an unprecedented [P_97] crunch .
sources with financial institutions said that if l&t is finalised as the joint [P_94] partner , [P_95] the [P_97] , procurement , construction contractor .
the company has proposed to [P_91] initial investment of $ 2 million in [P_94] subsidiary [P_95] be increased subsequently .
enron 's initiative in the field [P_92] watched with interest , a government official said .
the company has an installed wind power generator adjacent to its dabhol [P_94] in maharashtra which has been continuously gauging the nature of wind and [P_98] of using wind as a perennial source of power in the country .
according to the company 's official website , the western coast of the country has been identified as a [P_96] area of proposed [P_97] .
however , the site [P_91] does not [P_92] information on the exact location of [P_95] .
over the [P_90] decades , the company has designed and constructed wind power facilities around the world comprising more than 4,500 wind turbines and 1,600 mega watts of capacity .

skilling said he expected demand pressure to keep natural gas prices high for several years until demand [P_95] curbed or [P_97] production [P_97] into play , possibly by increasing the import of liquefied natural gas .

as a result , generators [P_91] supply power from different sources are most likely to benefit , analysts said .
[P_90] , the biggest utilities with excess capacity [P_93] also profit from supplying other generators with short - term power -- at high prices -- when they must buy to meet neta obligations .
' british energy plc , the u.k. 's biggest generator , has [P_94] to diversify its production away from a reliance on nuclear energy .

according to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the bank of italy in rome , clementi said the documentation recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be [P_912] to avert wider shocks in financial markets .
but these same customers [P_91] take on [P_92] exposure to other forms of credit through [P_95] instruments without increasing their borrowing .
he is also worried about how courts [P_92] countries would treat these contracts .
by andrea reierson consolidation in the global banking sector [P_93] it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the otc marketplace and [P_97] push them onto a centralised exchange , the bank for international settlements ( bis ) said in its quarterly review .
this increasing concentration of swap books [P_92] spark strong pressure [P_93] listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchange 's clearing house , bis said .
bis also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to [P_94] - term instruments , particularly in the us .
trading [P_90] rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in treasury notes and bonds with transactions in coupon - bearing us treasuries peaking in 1998 while those in private [P_911] continue to rise , the bis said .
the continued [P_90] of the [P_91] swaps market also underpinned demand for money market products , typically the most common hedging [P_97] swaptions .
nevertheless , though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings [P_99] of [P_910] banks , these problems , one [P_912] , will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions .
responses to a request for comment related to [P_92] basel accord and an alternative proposal by the fed [P_96] capital standards for u.s. banks show that most banks [P_910] basel accord , he said .

the [P_90] of creating a single ' master master ' agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed , with advocates citing such contracts would [P_99] efficiency by simplifying the negotiation [P_911] market operators .
doubts were expressed by some participants , however , regarding [P_93] a ' master master ' contract , especially concerning administration , legal and negotiation [P_99] cross - affiliate master agreements .
few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an [P_95] response , and the gains [P_97] by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks , " said bis economist serge jeanneau in the international body 's quarterly review .
janneau believes the falling number of non - government [P_93] will lead to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and asset - backed securities .
examples of likely [P_91] behaviour include the us bond market association 's move last september [P_95] proposals for a corporate bond futures contract , and cbot 's efforts [P_99] mortgage - backed contracts .

[P_90] , stan due to the relatively weak real - time market during morning hours , [P_95] a strategy for dec .
bidding or buying - back generation that you 've sold [P_93] .
[P_90] to stress that this is a relatively short - term strategy .
we have two strategies that [P_91] suggest : 1 .
you are still paid the day - ahead price for the day - ahead quantity , but instead of generating it , [P_97] it from the iso .
advantages - a relatively large upside , the price the iso charges [P_94] actually go negative , as large as negative $ 91.87 .
[P_90] to the physical problems [P_92] create , the settlements statement you receive [P_95] relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow .
[P_90] call [P_91] to reduce your generation , and the energy [P_94] - back in the real - time market [P_97] used to [P_99] prescheduled quantity .
as in the previous example , [P_92] cost to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10/mwh .
if [P_90] buy - back the energy for a price of $ 30 , then [P_95] $ 20/mwh .
[P_90] know exactly when and for how long the [P_93] be down or reduced .
also , the settlements statements [P_91] to manage .
at this point in time [P_91] encourage [P_92] start with the strategy # 2 , buying - back blocks of energy in the bi - lateral market .

before considering [P_90] landscape , it is worth [P_93] various phases of the market during the last few years .
nevertheless , despite the lack of highly leveraged [P_92] , companies throughout the region continued to fund long - term local currency investments with [P_98] term foreign currency (
this is expected to continue as [P_92] leads to a focus on yield [P_95] and credit risk management .
the emergence of domestic bond markets is having a positive [P_93] on [P_94] , both directly and indirectly .
there is a direct [P_91] where bond issues are swapped into a different currency ( in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market ) , or [P_99] ( where issuers [P_910] alter the [P_912] basis ) .
additionally , the increased availability of instruments in the market and greater demand [P_94] from investors is leading to [P_96] local currency products , such as options on domestic interest rates and securities .
finally , derivatives regulation in the region has generally been somewhat mixed , [P_94] countries adopting a prescriptive approach and others a risk - based approach .
[P_90] turn requires [P_91] regulatory consideration , which has generally been in line with international standards .
[P_90] , it is reasonable [P_92] a mend towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international regulatory standards .
there has been continual [P_91] as the number of users increases , more products become [P_95] and regulations put in place to allow healthy market [P_98] .
nevertheless , the derivatives markets [P_91] and [P_94] as end - users grow in number and sophistication , while [P_98] of products continues [P_99] .
but with the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act there [P_93] light at the end of the tunnel .
it is , however , widely expected - or at least [P_93] - that the forthcoming fourth financial markets enhancement act [P_97] the introduction of a statutory definition of borsentermingeschafte .
its conceptual scope is controvasial3 and the continuous [P_92] of new types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive [P_97] .
but the meager [P_91] provided by equity markets masked an [P_93] 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year , and a 14 per cent increase in exchange traded options .
use of [P_90] rate agreements more than doubled during the year to $ 1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year .
` ` the [P_91] rate market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for interest rate hedging , ' ' said mr. farrow .
` ` the market has [P_91] considerably .
bankers who [P_90] the basle committee on banking supervision say it is likely [P_95] three different [P_96] banking supervisors : basic [P_98] ( that is , a single proxy for the entire bank , such as trading volumes ) ; a business line approach using committee - imposed capital ratio ; or thirdly , internal measurement using a bank 's own loss data within a supervisory specified [P_920] .
the implication is [P_91] and [P_92] the internal measurement approach may result an the [P_96] appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option , based on internal modelling .
the principal message to regulators is that larger banks [P_93] operational risk measurement and management [P_95] achieve lower capital charges .
joseph sabitini , managing director in the corporate risk management group at jp morgan in new york , recognises that a [P_97] regulatory [P_97] must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management , but that it also includes a risk - based option for " those with [P_919] capability " .
stages three and four [P_91] to using technology for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm .
we have also [P_91] a number of quantification techniques , [P_93] their effectiveness [P_95] on the quality and quantity of the data available .
the current challenge is to find a way around the lack of data on big loss [P_95] .
according to tony peccia , vice - president in the [P_93] management division at cibc world markets in toronto , most banks [P_97] to be at the internal measurement [P_910] the proposed capital charge when implemented - which [P_913] on internal data .
the more consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from november 1 2000 and receive the first [P_95] scrubbed , anonymous data by the end of the year .
the paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach [P_93] institutions with poor [P_94] management [P_95] controls , but [P_97] to internal loss event data , to [P_910] a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss event data .
the paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation [P_93] risk [P_94] an institution that has recently [P_96] serious loss , but where [P_98] reacted and strengthened the control environment in [P_911] , and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence .
the paper argues blat there is [P_92] in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment [P_95] allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more precise means of calculating an [P_911] capital charge - institutions should [P_913] more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime should establish incentives [P_917] risk management and controls .
insurance and risk transfer will become an [P_92] and sophisticated component in an operational risk manager 's tool - box over [P_97] few years .
although some products on the market [P_92] immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster , [P_95] be certain arguments after the [P_98] .
rachlin also highlights reputational issues : " while insurance [P_93] cover the short - term financial [P_95] for some events the longer term reputation [P_98] greater concern .
insurance will play a role as an instrument for managing operational risk , but not in its [P_95] .... we are waiting for the regulators .
victor dowd , an associate involved with [P_92] capital charge [P_93] the uk 's financial services authority agrees [P_96] and [P_97] the internal measurement approach [P_910] result in [P_911] of appropriate models .

( paul is scheduled to speak to us [P_92] a decision .
[P_90] remember in the beginning of [P_92] we discussed piloting autonomy or an unstructured data management [P_96] in order to reach qualitative and quantitative information .
some discussion was lent to finding a product perhaps which would [P_93] identify experts .
[P_90] , we discussed the value [P_92] a product [P_93] identify experts [P_95] .
however , only 50 % of those interviewed suggested they would tag [P_94] others to search regardless if [P_96] identify experts .
but , over 90 % of those surveyed agreed an enterprise [P_93] .
autonomy provides some feature / functionality to search email ( the full extent of which [P_95] by the sst ) .

this distinction was arrived at [P_91] the characteristics described in the charter and associated survey as to what was meant by an unstructured data management [P_98] .

enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband : it 's a fragmented international market worth $ 300 billion a year , and [P_910] extend its [P_912] to this business and win a huge share of that market .
` ` i [P_91] our legacy [P_92] that we proved you [P_94] a [P_95] intellectual capital , not physical assets . ' ' a self - described business history buff , skilling argues that the era of corporate success based on gathering assets is over .

stacey , based on jeremy 's responses below , [P_93] alternative interest rate [P_96] keep the usd without system [P_98] .
let 's assume the following : postid currency - usd postid otc int type crv - alternative arg [P_96] curve deal currency - usd deal level interest curve - alternative arg [P_910] curve results : the portcalc [P_913] using the alternative arg interest rate [P_916] .
with an output currency code of " usd " , and your deals are booked in tagg to " aa int " for int ( [P_98] ) , then portcalc [P_910] the interest rate [P_912] you specify in your postid .
these 2 books do satisfy the above requirements , so [P_93] specify an alternate [P_95] in your postid , portcalc will pv with that curve .
due to the high probability that the argentine peso and the usd will not continue to be linked 1 to 1 , [P_97] to begin valuing the portfolios using an argentina interest rate curve .
and i recall that you thought it would require system [P_93] .
at this time [P_91] to [P_92] to specify usd but pv at an alternative [P_95] .
[P_90] i though about was possibly adding a new currency called argusd and having it use the alternative interest rate curve .

with the u.s. dollar weaking over the last month vs. most major currencies , and forecasts for it to continue to do so , ( which is clearly [P_99] enron while we [P_911] sell international assets ) , i [P_913] should think about selling [P_916] dated ( 6 month - to 1 year depending on when we [P_920] could actually sell something )

[P_90] jon , i guess it is n't critical that we see whether the trades are a buy or a sell .
the reason that i had requested this was to ensure that i has both sides of the trade but in [P_96] or short [P_99] on the circumstance .
therefore , [P_90] include the enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts .

i [P_90] the [P_91] to milbank , canadian and japanese counsel for them to review [P_95] with their research for us .
from our preliminary advice , i believe that [P_92] game similar to [P_95] in the [P_97] to avoid liability in various jurisdictions for violating trademark restrictions on the use of the terms olympics , sydney 2000 and the like .
[P_90] the games to most us residents as well as those european residents for which we received the green light during the euro2000 research .
[P_90] game to japanese residents so long as the prize has a value no greater than 100,000 yen .
we [P_90] not [P_91] the game to residents of australia or singapore ( see david minn 's e - [P_97] re australia ) .
if we [P_90] the game so that it complies with australian law , it appears that [P_96] still be required to seek a permit to [P_99] a game such as this ( notwithstanding [P_912] issue ) in australia .
[P_90] you talk to your commercial [P_92] many australian eol cps we currently have and whether it is worth the expenditure of [P_98] necessary to obtain a permit to [P_911] game [P_912] to those cps .
[P_90] of prizes through [P_91] triggers the requirement for a licence .
there is zero [P_91] of us getting [P_92] use sydney olympic names and images .

enron employees [P_90] permitted to participate although [P_92] restrictions placed on their [P_95] to win prizes .
if it [P_90] necessary to obtain a permit , [P_93] proceed [P_95] in trying to obtain one .
names and symbols , [P_91] to obtain a license to use the names .
it appears to be [P_91] marketing strategy the caution displayed in researching the law in various jurisdictions is justified .
if this correct then [P_91] a license .
i should [P_90] this [P_92] .
[P_90] also [P_91] issues relating to gaming which i [P_93] anne at b&m [P_95] on .

mr. hyvl , i just now had a [P_92] make a final review of the contract and noticed a couple of items : 1 .

we will [P_90] these throughout the day .
[P_90] to take the remainder of [P_93] - it is a [P_95] .

as i [P_90] this late last [P_92] then was called out of town , i have not had [P_96] to fully review it ; however , [P_99] i am heading .
if we use the eol gtc 's , [P_92] have to modify them to be applicable to cl , a process that [P_97] .
- i am still not [P_91] to [P_93] terms [P_94] that are necessary for certain products .
[P_90] leave them in the annex and merely indicate that anyone dealing with products in [P_95] for which [P_96] terms are attached to the annex [P_99] subject to those terms by accepting the annex ; however , this [P_913] the annex quite long .
[P_90] you should [P_92] else at this time .

the central points that i believe i [P_92] include the following , among others .
capital costs , having been sunk , can not [P_93] short run pricing ; the differing [P_95] of generating units [P_97] reflected in their market values , and thus [P_910] cost of production .
[P_90] units will have lower fuel costs ( for example ) , but higher [P_95] costs [P_95] of the capital assets .
anyway , i 'd [P_91] prepare such a report .

[P_90] on wednesday , september 19 , by tim belden and chris calger to [P_95] the floor as a [P_97] all you 've [P_99] enron this month .
i [P_90] see destiny 's child , what about you ?
i [P_90] too .
and i [P_90] 's a [P_92] a ruling .
to submit a suggestion for a [P_92] folder , [P_93] the suggestion [P_94] esource bulletin , the source .
do [P_90] us [P_91] this [P_92] the rest of mario 's positions ( under the distillates - products ii ) or leave it with crude ?
we have discussed [P_91] the systems group and [P_93] have the fix in place by wednesday reporting - they must do [P_97] behind the scenes .
[P_90] me a [P_91] changes .
after a string of weaker - than - expected economic data , friday 's employment report came in stronger [P_96] .
on the surface , this suggests [P_92] the economy ; however , the drop was caused by a decline in the number of people [P_98] jobs .
* net net , [P_91] see a very [P_93] outlook for jackup oriented companies .
[P_90] to forecast a long cycle , [P_92] utilization and rising day rates over the [P_95] or more years and highly attractive valuations .
* as [P_90] business signals are mixed and stocks remain volatile , we 're taking a 12 month view that trends for ems in 02 [P_98] be [P_99] significantly .
while [P_90] see [P_91] weakness in share prices [P_93] , investors [P_94] to position themselves for the eventual rebound , and calling the bottom has been [P_99] .
from a micro sense we believe top - tier ems cos [P_93] achieve 20 % top and bottom line growth in 02 , y / y , [P_99] outsourcing wins .
[P_90] wins are positioning altera well for a recovery when the inventory is gone but the bigger question is how [P_96] that take and what is the slope of that recovery .
demand during the summer [P_91] of [P_93] estimate change .
in our view , some of these stocks have begun to discount a fundamental recovery that is not yet fully substantiated by market conditions ; however , the intermediate - term outlook has become somewhat [P_911] and ( perhaps more importantly ) current valuations of certain stocks in our coverage universe still leave [P_918] incremental upside appreciation potential over [P_920] year or more , particularly after the modest pull - back that the group experienced over the last week and a half .
we believe that the spx and ndx [P_92] a [P_93] rate cuts .
while we believe the company continues to effectively [P_92] its business and have a high level of confidence in ceo paul charron , we recognize that the uncertainty in senior management is unsettling and believe [P_911] of the situation [P_913] a [P_914] the shares .
visibility at the company remains [P_91] , with backlog continuing to exceed one q of revenue .

and i [P_90] detailed directions [P_92] .
[P_90] those that showed up yesterday .
on special [P_90] , he cited the departure of kris stockton , who handled all the kicking duties last [P_96] , and said [P_97] a [P_98] kicking game [P_99] a key to having a succesfful season .
tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed [P_94] promise for [P_95] .
he and most of the other defensive tackles are smaller and [P_93] than hampton and rogers , [P_95] front four show a lot of improvement in pass rushing .
the tackles this year wo n't be as [P_92] against the run as hampton and rogers , who were run - stoppers deluxe , but they [P_98] , and , lets face it , the best teams on the ut regular - season schedule are geared to passing .
but let 's [P_91] some of the walk - on kickers the ut staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced [P_97] kick field goals .
if they ca n't , and if this team is as [P_93] as it has a [P_95] be , brown [P_97] himself in the same boat as florida state coach bobby bowden , who lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he did n't have guys [P_917] make a chip - shot field goal when the game was on the line .
i 'll report on them in depth in my [P_93] newsletter .
they are supposed to be [P_91] , and they will [P_93] be .
brown said the longhorns will [P_91] this year and that [P_94] the team .
so , instead of picking the southern and northern divisions , i 'm going to pick the way i [P_96] the big 12 [P_97] up , from top to bottom , as a single entity .
brown says he is n't going to get caught up in pre - [P_94] hype this year because it does n't make sense to [P_98] to [P_98] how a [P_99] do when it has n't even started practicing .
the doctors told me i could [P_92] again in three or four weeks
and , if i miss any games , it should n't [P_93] than the first one or two .
the longhorns were already thin at defensive end , and [P_93] critically short if mcclintock is out for a [P_97] period of time .
he did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end ( from linebacker ) in the spring and is a guy we [P_97] hopes for this season .
he said he [P_91] go to a school where he has a [P_94] log some playing time .
if the injury does cost mcclintock significant playing time , the coaches [P_94] some moves to [P_95] depth .
incoming freshman eric hall , who had been ticketed forfullback , [P_93] a [P_94] candidate for a switch to defensive end .
but we 've got to do a [P_92] day to day and week to week .
if benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge quickly , i [P_96] he 'll play and play a lot early in the season .

i [P_90] at length at [P_93] intrastate pipeline association meeting on june 22 ( to be hosted by redmond at enron's / hpl 's offices ) .
if [P_90] passes , you will have one [P_93] year to [P_94] a voluntary emissions reduction permit ( verp ) .
note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp - that [P_98] as though [P_99] get [P_910] facilities permitted without having to use today 's bact .
if that attempt is successful , [P_92] to apply for a verp [P_94] gone on september 1 .
i am not certain [P_91] to exist .
[P_90] , i 've appended some information on 10-year old bact for gas - fired ic engines and turbines that [P_97] are trying to get a verp now .
if while processing the application , the commission determines that [P_93] information is necessary [P_94] or to take final action on the application , the commission [P_99] the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response .
the owner or operator of a grandfathered facility [P_92] apply for a permit to operate the facility under this section .
the commission [P_90] issue an existing facility flexible [P_92] some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site .
the commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate [P_96] be required than in other areas , but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate [P_913] required in any area .
because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is [P_94] , it is doubtful if significant control [P_97] achieved through the permit system at this time .
i believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the trncc [P_95] to [P_96] of guidelines for 10-year bact for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the verp program .
grandfathered engines and turbines that [P_91] to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_95] will not [P_96] subject to an economic reasonableness review .
grandfathered engines and turbines that are not [P_92] to be controlled to the 2 - 8 gram [P_95] permittable under a verp if there is test data to [P_910] old ( pre - modification ) [P_912] ( post - modification ) emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved .
also needed [P_90] a representation of the cost of the controls and even though [P_95] modifications are [P_96] , the [P_97] cost is prohibitive .
i [P_90] all of this is [P_92] .
if [P_90] .
, you asked for an example of what we would consider " [P_94] emission reductions " that [P_95] acceptable in a case - by - case review when the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level [P_913] not be achieved .
also needed in the case - by - case review [P_93] a representation of what the cost of the controls [P_97] with a discussion of why the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr nox level could not be achieved .
[P_90] be due [P_91] limitations such as no [P_93] controls or modifications are [P_95] , or [P_96] identify cost in dollars per [P_98] nox controlled to show that even though additional modifications [P_912] , the cost is prohibitive .
after my first read , [P_91] .
at that time older rich burn engines [P_92] been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g / hp - hr limit for nox .

we [P_90] this [P_91] your members to decide which engines they [P_94] either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december 7 , 2000 .
for each engine or turbine , please submit a , table 29 or 31 as applicable , and other [P_96] information [P_97] support the standard exemption claim .
for engines [P_90] authorized by a verp permit , [P_93] identify each engine by unit number , epn , air quality account number , and plant name , [P_910] of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the verp program .
when the verp applications are submitted , information [P_92] provided to show that nox emissions [P_95] in the 2 to 8 g / hp - hr [P_99] .
information showing that actual emissions reductions [P_92] achieved , even when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g / hp - hr can not be met , [P_99] staff review of the application .

a controversial issue in these proceedings has been whether the costs of transco 's twelve incrementally - priced [P_96] and southern [P_97] projects [P_97] rolled into transco 's system - wide rates .
the 1999 policy statement , however , has a threshold requirement for [P_94] requiring that there [P_95] no subsidization [P_97] customers - in other words , no increase in costs of any kind .
the pgt order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs [P_94] increase for existing shippers ; therefore , pgt had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that [P_914] apply absent the new compression .

[P_90] recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he would n't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups .
i [P_90] to get your take on the following kind of big picture enron policy on wspp approach .
every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements [P_94] and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements , one that is almost [P_914] the other one .
the wspp should be focusing on more boondoggles and more [P_93] like [P_94] for rto west , dealing with the emerging california changes , and open access in oregon and nevada .
therefore , this policy would let our marketers praise the wspp for being a [P_94] organization , but at the same time , advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to [P_913] .
rosman should say : enron loves the wspp , it has done a [P_94] with the contract reformation , that task is done , we now should [P_99] to [P_910] tasks .

ifr - november 17 , 2001 standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company should serve as reference entity [P_96] default swaps in [P_97] of a demerger or other structural change , such as a consolidation , will be put [P_913] by the international [P_915] derivatives association this week .
while the successor issue has been debated since the break - up of national power of the uk , the imminent break - ups of at&t and bt into smaller entities has underscored the [P_911] for [P_912] documentation .
it came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active new [P_95] dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit [P_98] us corporate default swaps .
[P_90] definition was agreed at the end of april and released in [P_94] , but liquidity in the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate .
the issue of obligation acceleration had not been a [P_93] concern for dealers until moody 's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a " soft " credit event in the default swaps that back credit - linked [P_914] collateralised debt obligations .
[P_90] trigger exercise on a default swap , when there was still a [P_94] the covenant [P_96] made whole before the fundamental default event - failure [P_99] a debt payment - had taken place .
derivatives dealing heads [P_91] echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of [P_95] will still be [P_96] request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap .
the international [P_90] derivatives association last week [P_92] fpml.org , a non - profit industry body dedicated to developing a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions .
in theory , liquidity should [P_91] a boost from a move to greater [P_94] .
for smaller end users it means that there is less [P_93] involved in entering into a transaction , " said lynn .
no decision on linking fpml 's transaction standards with isda [P_93] has been made yet , but such a move is likely in [P_98] .
joining forces [P_90] raise [P_92] of fpml , but awareness of its [P_95] is not a problem said lynn .
fpml.org 's architectural [P_91] group , and its [P_92] covering [P_93] rate , foreign exchange and equity derivatives , will continue to exist as sub - groups [P_99] 's new fpml committee .
isda 's fpml committee will retain responsibility for approving [P_93] of the standard .
fpml standards currently exist for [P_91] rate derivative products and [P_93] rate agreements .

i [P_90] kirk steven 's this afternoon and after [P_93] our preliminary closing estimates for power cost [P_96] , our june current estimate of power cost , and the amount of [P_911] ( 25 million ) we had targeted for the second quarter here is what we concluded based upon the assumption that prices [P_919] do not continue to degrade [P_920] levels like they have over the last month .
there are two sensitivities to this estimate [P_92] lower this number by a combined 6.5 million .
first we understand that [P_91] be allocated charges for the tomas [P_94] ran through the pgg books last year .
[P_90] have to write - off these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in a peoplesoft system environment .
[P_90] need to resolve [P_91] the 2nd quarter or take the write - off which would reduce our ebit .

key discussion points 1 ) [P_91] competition and supply chain in general
there has been a lot of discussion and controversy surrounding market share and competitive wins regarding the [P_95] market and the three major vendors ( itwo , manu and sap ) .
the best gauge we have for [P_92] market share is license revenue [P_94] for the last [P_95] quarters .
on the [P_90] , manu has [P_92] vertical diversification with a focus on transportation management and has won deals of [P_97] high tech .

if we decide so to use the floor we [P_93] within a couple of weeks at most .
we 'd [P_90] several people in each office to fit everyone into [P_95] .
that means to [P_91] work as is hpl would have to remain on our network and [P_95] telecom service [P_97] our nortel switch during the stay in three allen since there [P_911] nowhere for aep to put servers or switches on the floor without [P_916] build out .

[P_90] , in addition to persons having the titles listed in article 262 ( above ) , the general view is that persons having titles such as general manager and division manager ( bucho ) , [P_912] be deemed to have the authority to represent the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the company 's business for which they are responsible .
in formulating an approach for enron to take on the basis of [P_94] law , the following [P_96] : ( a ) practice regarding representative director seal

since the law concerning execution by a representative director [P_93] considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in some countries , and by two directors [P_910] example
accordingly , it [P_91] necessary for enron to take a more stringent approach to [P_95] in this respect than it does [P_97] the same products in other countries .

sme lenders ' initial concerns included the steepness of basel 's credit risk weighting [P_94] the internal ratings - based ( irb ) approach , its insistence that expected loss provisions [P_910] made in [P_912] typical unexpected loss provisions , confusion over which sme loans [P_916] included under the retail approach , and the extent to which physical collateral [P_920] used as a risk mitigant .

the committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected losses [P_93] to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses - credit risk .
we fear that [P_91] lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for german banks because of tax regulations , so we [P_97] much against covering expected losses with regulatory capital .

since we have [P_91] on [P_92] then converting that into xml , [P_94] has a natural [P_96] isda , " says meinel , operating from inside isda [P_910] of fpml [P_912] aligned with [P_913] of [P_914] as it comes along .
strain robert pickel , isda 's chief executive officer , says the merger [P_94] members of fpml [P_96] on [P_97] .
we envision adding [P_91] staff , and we project that [P_93] to find the extra funding needed through due - based revenues ' says pickel .
creating fpml is as [P_91] the isda [P_92] agreement , because it will strengthen [P_95] for the swap negotiation .

leading european and us banks [P_91] how new rules on capital adequacy will operate , raising the possibility that final proposals from the basle committee [P_99] delayed .
they are also asking [P_91] the way operational risk - unexpected losses - [P_95] treated , and [P_97] on aspects of securitisation , counterparty risk and disclosure .
the letter points out that in a number [P_92] areas the basle committee 's second consultation document has either come [P_97] new proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come .
" taken together these greener areas [P_92] a critical [P_93] the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole , " the letter says .
we [P_90] concerned that if the calibration is not done properly , that will go up and [P_96] have a serious effect on the economy , " the european banking federation said .

while [P_90] is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions ( hli ) , credit providers [P_98] make [P_99] the measurement of credit exposures , a global banking watchdog said friday .
although a separate study [P_91] to set out a basis for [P_94] public disclosure of financial risks has [P_96] , actual [P_98] introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for hlis and hedge funds has been limited , the fsf report said .
at the same time , improvements have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on hli exposures , general standards of credit analysis , due [P_99] documentation , the fsf reported .
and foreign exchange market participants have agreed to a set of so - called [P_94] practice guidelines for foreign exchange trading .
this [P_90] address concerns that large and concentrated hli positions [P_93] the [P_94] materially influence market dynamics [P_96] and medium - [P_98] open economies , according to the fsf report .
while progress is being made in addressing [P_92] in legal documentation practices , it has proven difficult to achieve [P_96] the consistency , where appropriate , between different industry standards , the report added .
while [P_90] progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk , management and regulatory oversight of so - called highly leveraged institutions ( hlis ) , credit providers [P_910] to [P_910] the measurement of credit exposures , the global banking watchdog said .
disclosure of information by hlis to banks and other credit providers has [P_94] in terms of both quality and quantity , the bank for international settlements said last week .
the banks said they feared the legislation [P_92] discourage international investors from trading in hong [P_95] shares , undermining the sar 's position as an international market .
however , they [P_91] to do so under [P_93] law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares [P_96] derivatives .
the stricter disclosure requirement [ in the bill compared with ] international practices [P_94] to reduce manipulation activities , " she said .
[P_90] netting provisions to include a wider [P_92] otc products has been a priority for the international swaps and derivatives association and the bond market association ( bma ) since the mid1990s .
in two high - profile reports in 1999 by the president 's [P_94] group - one [P_95] - term capital management and one on otc derivatives regulation - us regulators acknowledged that [P_911] netting law would reduce systemic risk .
the definition of swaps has been stretched to cover [P_93] rate agreements , [P_94] foreign exchange contracts and other instruments .
friction developed between the [P_91] securities contracts with regard to netting across them , " says dan cunningham , a [P_97] allen & overy [P_98] york and isda 's legal counsel .
[P_90] have [P_91] collateral and an array of products to [P_93] for safe harbour " netting and settlement will [P_96] faster and [P_98] under the new bill , he adds .
the organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the u.s. district court for the southern district [P_97] york .
the three groups contended that because a wide [P_92] factors can affect the market price of a futures contract , the imposition of ' " any continuing duty to furnish all price information and information of all facts likely [P_913] the market price [P_915] so burdensome as to be unreasonable .
the narrow [P_90] of a broker 's duty to a nondiscretionary account [P_94] applies fully to a futures broker , the groups wrote .
the eurobond market was a response to a new withholding tax on [P_94] payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds .
at [P_90] of 2000 , outstanding otc derivatives amounted to $ 2,800bn according to the bank for international settlements , or just over half the value of [P_99] international debt securities .
[P_90] there [P_90] a limit to the efficiency gains that [P_93] wrung from the global financial system through innovation ?
either way , there [P_91] always be [P_92] for increasing efficiency in the financial system .
while portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage [P_93] derivatives , the scope for innovation is less obvious than [P_97] to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation .
but only a visceral optimist could assume that financial innovation [P_93] at the pace of the past quarter - century .
airlines , especially those concentrated in a particular hub , [P_93] use weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather [P_96] many more delays than they are used to , notes claudio ribeiro , head of [P_912] development , weather risk management group , enron .
weather has n't presented itself to - date to be sufficiently fungible [P_94] to build a broad market on , yet it 's a pretty big market nonetheless , " adds robert levin , senior vice - president , [P_913] control [P_914] , at the new york [P_916] exchange .
through the otc market , [P_91] kind of structure , " ribeiro says .
to compensate , a realistic hourly weather [P_92] engine is needed [P_93] replicate thousands of multi - regional weather [P_96] , said rookley .
initial [P_90] were that the treasury 's [P_92] a fortnight ago would prompt the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations - and thus [P_97] fuel credit derivative market growth .
on [P_90] examination , those [P_91] seem to be fading .
also , the assets [P_91] for synthetic securitisation are relatively small , " said chris carman , a vice - president within jp morgan 's structured products group in london .
while some smaller building societies [P_91] candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations , others [P_98] not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations .
the smaller building societies [P_91] be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations , [P_94] not [P_95] to build the infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives , noted janet tavakoli , executive director and head of structuring [P_913] for credit derivatives at westlb in london .
building societies [P_90] to be securitising an asset pool of more than e500 m to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of [P_98] these transactions is quite sizeable , other industry officials said .
a building society 's ability to use credit derivatives hinges on where it fits on a bsc - created spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient [P_99] in using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and [P_913] credit derivatives business .
an institution ranked in the middle of the five - tier spectrum will have to apply and [P_95] a strong case for why it [P_98] use credit derivatives .
building societies are most likely to use synthetic securitisations [P_93] product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a [P_98] or for transferring the risk of higher - weighted assets , industry officials said .
the changes [P_90] building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the bsc 's regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the fsa in november .
according to some industry officials , building societies ' current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk [P_96] turn out to be what prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market .
theoretically , credit derivatives [P_91] the place of mortgage guarantees .
the societies have [P_91] to use only interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives .
it has been a [P_91] quarter for the big us energy trading firms .
we continue [P_90] generating capacity , which [P_93] inventory of [P_94] capacity [P_95] low - cost , high - value [P_98] in a highly volatile market - place , " skilling said .
audit david yeres , a partner specialising in derivatives law at clifford [P_94] rogers & wells [P_95] york , says : " a number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of the documentation .
he adds : " [P_91] very hard at upgrading our contracts , we 're analysing our contracts in light of market [P_97] our [P_98] california .
clifford [P_90] 's yeres expects that i the california crisis will accelerate acceptance of more - sophisticated master agreements .
for instance , [P_91] set up [P_92] of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees , or any type of [P_97] mechanism .
i know a lot of the suppliers have added quite a bit [P_94] language for transactions with the california department of water ,
however , the concepts contained in the eel master that are similar to those in the isda master agreement . which has stood [P_97] of time and been proven in court .
isda itself has an initiative under way that , [P_93] , [P_94] energy marketers operating in california .
it [P_90] at [P_91] master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions .
haedicke , who is [P_91] board member and chair of the energy [P_94] products committee [P_95] into this , says : " it would be a much [P_99] world [P_910] a way to [P_913] isda master for both physically and financially settled transactions , and find a way to net across physical and financial collateral collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the california crisis .
under the concept of " adequate assurances " [P_92] , a party to a [P_95] with " reasonable " grounds to be insecure about the ability of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities [P_912] demand performance assurance such as collateral .
[P_90] documentation , some energy traders [ have ] been [P_93] terminate [P_94] - out [P_96] an earlier stage than others using the so - called ' early termination events '
the costs and [P_91] costs of [P_92] this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the california crisis are long remembered .
isma said these bodies needed to [P_92] in a constructive way to [P_94] a more harmonised security settlement environment in europe to " substantially reduce " the number of failed transactions .
the organisation 's intervention [P_91] pressure on europe 's 26 different clearing and settlement systems [P_95] up co - operation so costs can [P_98] reduced .

at the end of the call , pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was [P_97] , but at the end he said that he [P_910] through a number of the issues
we said that [P_91] be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that [P_98] then " [P_99] notes .
pirog said cdwr [P_91] willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an [P_95] adversely affects cdwr 's [P_97] perform under the contract , most particularly its ability to pay for power .
( such an [P_91] likely [P_91] a ca legislature or regulatory generated change ) .
right that has been offered , it was discussed that [P_93] be structured in such a way that epmi [P_96] walk from the deal ( without receiving or paying a termination payment ) up until a date certain ( september 1 and september 30 were mentioned by me as [P_916] , although pirog said that other suppliers had a [P_920] window )
pirog said he thought cdwr [P_91] with us on that .
however , he said cdwr [P_91] willing to consider having a downgrade [P_94] a " no ld walk right " for epmi and perhaps an [P_98] justifying epmi in suspending deliveries .
in other words , a downgrade [P_92] treated [P_93] an event of default , but no termination payment [P_96] owed and epmi would have [P_99] to suspend performance .
however , when asked about the idea of a cross default out w / out a termination payment , he stated that he [P_97] with cdwr .
my sense is that [P_91] get [P_93] it in general .
i [P_90] that the situs issue [P_92] a big one for richard sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise .
pirog offered to [P_91] sample language , which we said [P_93] .
also , he said it was a possibility that the california attorney general would issue the [P_95] the bonds , [P_97] might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from hawkins .
pirog stated that [P_91] covenants we have requested are conceptually [P_93] him , [P_95] to [P_96] internally with cdwr .
pirog said he [P_91] up with cdwr [P_92] often it plans to give suppliers financial information .

after [P_90] relevant commercial , legal and environmental [P_93] project managers [P_95] personnel , enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken : 1 .
assuming that pgl assumes the role of buyer under the terms of the land purchase agreement executed between pgl and air liquide on 4/11/2000 and pgl plans [P_99] to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing , perc and pgl [P_912] immediately begin [P_913] of the documents necessary to achieve the icc approval of any future transfer ( sale , lease , or alternative structure ) of the torrence south parcel from pgl to torrence power llc .
this recommendation is based upon the belief that although the torrence south parcel does hold [P_95] to perc and enron as a [P_97] site , [P_99] viability and risk / reward profile of the commercial [P_912] has not yet been sufficiently finalized .
the site ( in combination with the calumet project ) represents an integral component [P_94] a commercial solution to the mission energy / comed 500 mw " in - city " regulatory obligation to the city of the chicago .
the factors contributing to the [P_91] perc and enron not to [P_94] to [P_94] 6/26/00 are listed [P_96] :
the incomplete status of [P_91] commercial [P_92] associated with the torrence south parcel .
d. perc and enron 's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while [P_95] commercial [P_96] associated value proposition prior to executing an icc - approved land [P_911] pgl to torrence power llc .
the south parcel represents a [P_91] power [P_92] site upon which perc and enron [P_95] continue to conduct due [P_97] development activities .
perc and [P_90] risk mitigation strategies including land options , environmental indemnifications , and other [P_96] which protect their respective assets and [P_98] economic viability of a [P_910] on the torrence south parcel .
perc [P_90] personnel have estimated that the icc [P_92] require up to 6 months ( the transfer of the calumet parcel was " fast - tracked " and took 3 months to achieve icc approval ) .
this risk [P_90] viability of an ' 01 in - service [P_94] a torrence power llc [P_96] .
perc and [P_90] a binding agreement which specifies an approval and cost - sharing mechanism [P_96] development decisions on the torrence south parcel .
such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing / selldown strategy currently under development by perc and enron for all of the chicago development [P_911] .

although [P_90] be the last ease this year , recent market moves [P_94] that the fed has done enough to support [P_97] a recovery in h2 .
it turns out that what they really were [P_92] see was something [P_94] a formal biological [P_96] ( ba ) for cs 3 and cs 4 , not a biological survey report [P_911] provided .
he said that only [P_91] were going to [P_93] findings of " [P_94] affect " [P_95] they maybe [P_96] the [P_97] get [P_98] concurrence from the usfws .
mark , i am [P_91] report that everyone has [P_93] extremely hard to collect all of the information that has [P_97] ( and then some ) for purposes of [P_910] due diligence [P_912] .
while [P_90] current [P_91] awano and seguchi we touched upon [P_94] reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization .
[P_90] enron [P_91] to review and [P_92] the assumptions we have utilized i still [P_95] share some fundamental numbers [P_97] in order to put this value into [P_910] .
in other words , if we were to flip [P_93] at [P_94] it [P_95] worth at least this much .
looked at another way , discounting the npv back to 2001 at 15 % results in a current npv of $ 558 million , or more than $ 34 per current [P_910] share !
[P_90] hard to believe [P_92] that your due diligence will bear them out .
[P_90] just these two [P_91] placing a ridiculously low 20 % [P_94] on them [P_96] with the $ 3 per share of cash on our balance sheet gives you nearly $ 20 per share current value .
this is without considering oita or any of the other many [P_93] are [P_94] on .
if enron , with all of its significant resources [P_93] , were to fully support [P_95] on these two [P_96] believe that [P_98] of their [P_99] quite high .
( we have been receiving [P_91] support from the global lng group by the way )
this is also why i [P_91] that we focus our immediate attention on these two [P_95] perhaps the oita [P_97] .
i [P_90] that [P_91] agree that reaching a conclusion as [P_93] is in all shareholders interests .
my main concern continues to be that the current infighting between [P_93] and e power has limited enron 's ability to recognize 1 ) the quality and significant capabilities of the employees of e power and 2 ) the [P_913] that has [P_914] through the nearly 2 years of systematic and comparative analysis of all of [P_919] greenfield sites [P_920] as well as the [P_920] respect to brownfield developments .
within [P_90] six [P_91] to take off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive development sites [P_98] leaving little for the late comers to the japanese market .
we continue to [P_91] a way [P_93] our mutual energies on building value in [P_96] market rather than on non - [P_99] bickering and turf wars .

some industry insiders [P_91] these higher prices will spread to other deregulated states in [P_94] .
[P_90] , the high summer temperatures meant utilities ate into their existing reserves to generate more electricity .
the cost to go into a [P_92] and market to [P_93] is so high while the return on residential customers is so low that the pursuit of residential customers just may not [P_911] it for non - incumbent utilities .

i had a call with trena mcfarland today picking up on earlier discussions with respect to [P_95] for the softs business to be conducted out of london and new [P_910] ( [P_910] e : mail of 2/2/01 for detailed discussion of the alternatives ) .
trena said that there was a strong legal preference to use ena rather than a new us corporation for the trading activity conducted out of new york , and that ectric ( or [P_911] llc ) through eeft [P_912] the principal for uk trading activity .
as a result of this trena is considering establishing parallel books such that , for example , the london based traders [P_97] offer prices on nybot look - alike and the nybot / liffe spread trades as well as offering prices on the liffe [P_914] - alike trades .
the [P_90] this route is that there is the possibility of arbitrage since the [P_95] have overlapping hours of trading .
the possibility of arbitrage [P_91] restricted to those counterparties which are registered both with london and [P_95] eol and are thus [P_98] see both prices with a bit of collusion - this [P_912] most likely in the case of a global counterparty which is operating through one or more branches .

an industry comment period [P_91] global capital rules dubbed " basel 2 " ends on thursday , but [P_96] will just [P_97] for banks calculating how the sweeping [P_910] affect their businesses .
one reason for the haste is that the basel committee on banking supervision [P_94] rules worries an industry stalemate [P_97] adoption of the badly - [P_99] rules in [P_910] jurisdictions .
banks complain basel 2 's calibration formulae , as spelled out in a draft published in january , penalise the irb approach , saying set - asides for risky corporates , for example , [P_911] higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks .
one fear is that [P_91] lead [P_92] mid - [P_93] banks using the standardised approach to wind up with a disproportionately [P_97] exposure to riskier borrowers .
supervisors are expected to [P_91] the kinks , however , and are expected to take into account data collected by the basel committee under a quantitative impact study ( www.bis.org ) .
but now [P_90] as though it [P_92] changed .
the basel committee [P_91] finish analysing these [P_92] , and is [P_94] them into the [P_96] version of basel 2 .
some private bankers worry that asking banks to set aside capital for such risk [P_94] the burgeoning business of wealth management which in theory requires a low capital base compared to lending or trading activities .
by kathleen [P_90] dubbed virtual portfolios , risk measurement services that include a ' what - if ' scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance .
deutsche 's ' what - if positions change ' enhancement , released to clients in mid - [P_95] , includes features to determine [P_97] value at risk ( var ) , tracking error and surplus - at - risk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations .
managers who [P_90] use of the client risk reporting enhancement would have a better [P_95] whether a particular [P_96] correlate a fund to an index , for example .
the current var analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community , which is now [P_95] predictors of risk .
var is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture [P_94] move in an index , for example , said guillaume blacher , senior managing director , pricing advisory and risk management .
more managers [P_90] , rather than have a single number that comes out once a day , " she said , referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices .
the hypothetical scenario tools , along with the traditional var risk measurement systems , [P_94] by fund managers in a complementary way , stated reech capital 's blacher .
hypothetical analysis tools will [P_91] risk manager in deciphering what positions are needed to get back within a fund manager 's limit , he added .
the [P_90] for [P_91] more reliable scenario hedging for managers investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for ' what - if ' scenario analysis lately .
he also credits the more educated investor who [P_92] prompting the fund manager to install [P_95] risk management and reporting systems , particularly [P_98] based funds , as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis .
however , the current risk measurement systems [P_92] expensive for all but the largest trading organisations , [P_96] for start - up funds .
the fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now [P_93] is beginning [P_94] for hedge funds [P_97] up , according to imagine 's cannon .
with the right risk analysis tools , a hedge fund [P_93] up and running in a week , instead of hiring an entire it staff , he said .

while volatility levels dropped in the first [P_92] of the year due to supply and demand [P_95] , the past month has seen volatilities begin [P_98] up again .
[P_90] , with the current supply and demand imbalance , that vols [P_94] rise more significantly than they have , " he says .
the fact that vols have not risen in this way creates [P_93] value for those [P_95] to use equity derivatives .

rac is comfortable with the changes , as it will result in a [P_94] saving in storage costs and allow the [P_97] trader to flatten his book .
[P_90] , whilst there maybe the potential of mtm movement between the $ 180 purchase price from borealis and the subsequent sale ( index related price ) back to the counterpart , this [P_911] netted out .
the only issue is whether houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early , [P_96] range between $ 1,200,000-?1,400,000 .
if this is feasible i will [P_92] we negotiate a discount of $ 15 on storage costs ( saving $ 600,000 ) as opposed to $ 10 .
the likely timeframe for selling the product [P_92] jan. 2002 as that is the highest otc swap price mkt which in turn would mean payment to borealis would be due on 30 days past b / l.

however , the annual company matching contributions remain limited to 50 percent of an employee 's pre - tax [P_96] , up to 6 percent of eligible compensation .
the company match in effect prior to its suspension was $ .50 for each $ 1 contributed , so the maximum amount the employee would have received in company [P_99] contributions [P_910] have been $ 5,500 , or half of $ 11,000 .
truing up " the match for previous [P_92] many participants in the plan expressed concern that [P_95] to the plan prior to july were not eligible for the reinstated company match .
[P_90] the end of 2002 , the matched amount falls short of the maximum level [P_95] based on the participant 's annual pre - tax [P_98] the plan , the company will " true up " their [P_913] 2002 to ensure the company [P_915] equal what would have been received had the match not been suspended .
for example , if an active employee 's annual pre - tax contribution to the [P_95] reach $ 11,000 , and on july 1 the employee has already contributed $ 7,000 , the remaining employee pre - tax [P_913] allowed [P_913] $ 4000 .

after january 1 , 2002 any participants in the plan hired or re - hired after january 1 , 2002 , [P_97] not [P_97] for the double match .
