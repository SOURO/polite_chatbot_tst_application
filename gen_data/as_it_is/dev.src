at [P_90] $ 100 million , it was a good investment .
burstein sees the current situation as analogous to the savings - and - loan crisis and [P_95] real - estate collapse of the late 1980s to early 1990s .
having worked at the blackstone group lp prior to [P_93] mtvlp , burstein has [P_95] institutional memory of what a big [P_97] .
pervasive computing means that new appliances , new security systems , new hvac installations in buildings , whether commercial or residential , will [P_97] server farms to exchange information constantly .
so it 's not surprising that major investment houses are scouring the countryside , [P_94] internet - infrastructure companies [P_96] the coming of all of [P_99] technologies .
but after 18 months of virtually no activity , with huge pools of investment money sitting on the sidelines in cash accounts , the [P_98] game has quietly restarted .
the last wave [P_91] in a whole [P_92] of dotcom companies -- especially shopping bots .
as peer - to - peer computing advances , shopping bots will not only [P_94] to [P_95] the [P_96] given item , but they [P_99] the ability to auction out [P_912] .
bid [P_90] out on the internet , and the gap [P_93] you $ 1,000 worth of merchandise for $ 850 .
if the s&l / real - estate crisis is a suitable analogy , it 'll [P_95] five years to get from here to there .

it hired two m.b.a.s last year [P_92] at least three more this year .
[P_90] compensation packages [P_91] from $ 88,000 to $ 110,000 -- lower than those that investment banks and consulting companies [P_96] new m.b.a. hires , which [P_98] as high as $ 145,000 .

i2 expressed considerable [P_91] in [P_91] below the executive level , but enw had difficulty getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2 .
i2 's response to the enron offer was that they considered it high and that they [P_95] with enron in some manner in [P_98] some form [P_910] .
since those early discussions with i2 , enw has discussed [P_93] opportunity with other selected technology companies , and is now considering bids from several [P_98] counterparties .
generally speaking the deal structure that appears to [P_92] best [P_93] both parties entails involvement by enw after the transaction , in the form of equity participation or royalty payments or both , as well as the transfer of some enron people .
this seems [P_90] us into the realm of a " partnership " structure [P_94] the initial i2 interest .
[P_90] to [P_91] we give i2 [P_92] to outline a [P_94] a price as well as outline [P_97] for a relationship [P_98] , or to confirm that they are not [P_912] .
enron remains [P_90] exploring [P_91] with i2 if there is a genuine [P_94] from i2 . 2 .
enron is moving down the path with other parties , so if i2 has [P_94] , [P_95] them [P_98] .

clearly i was outvoted , since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to csc and [P_98] flash report [P_910] quickly ( for power only ) ; an [P_913] scope would have compromised timely [P_915] .

el paso says it 's open to [P_92] system el paso natural gas " is willing [P_95] its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a project [P_911] be demonstrated through long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc .
the pipeline 's comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider [P_95] of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion [P_99] a system [P_910] ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west .
daniel m. adamson , director of ferc 's office of energy [P_93] , raised the prospect in a jan. 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying the project " could [P_910] difficult situation " now facing the california gas market .
el paso proposed the line 2000 project as a [P_93] line to replace [P_94] compression , and not as a system [P_97] .
however , " there are several ways that [P_92] accomplished , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan. 15 .
el paso [P_90] to the proposed line 2000 project , or [P_94] replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place .
as a third option , he said el paso [P_93] to its [P_95] or [P_96] either [P_96] system or line 2000 [P_98] .
the " preferable method [P_91] to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity , i.e. where they want to put gas into el paso 's system and where they want the gas delivered , " clark said .
as a " first step " towards gauging market support for [P_93] , he noted that el paso on jan. 12 posted 1.2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline [P_910] sale effective june 1 of this year .
when the posting results are known , " el paso [P_93] whether another [P_94] is needed to solicit expressions of [P_97] pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california .
if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand [P_93] capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " will [P_98] whether [P_99] of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 [P_913] , or both , is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted .
not only [P_90] the project " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso 's current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service [P_99] a " necessary prerequisite " to any [P_912] the pipeline 's system , according to clark .

[P_90] keep the termination currency specified in us dollars .
the monthly round table meeting between the tw team [P_93] has been set for january the 25th at 3pm .
while we are describing this as a " young friends " event , any and all [P_95] , you [P_96] to be young at heart ! !
[P_90] to kick this organization off right ! !
[P_90] there ! !
we had a brief but [P_91] meeting on 7 february , since when i have discussed and signed a contract with annette patrick .
i was [P_90] before now , but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded this .
i thought [P_90] to recap [P_92] now are and what i have in mind .
you summarised the three topics where further [P_92] you as 1 .
[P_90] aim to bring this to a wider audience , but there are lots of papers on this topic now , and the situation [P_98] almost daily , so [P_910] it into a paper on europe .
i [P_90] talk to kyran on this and related topics , either [P_94] , and maybe he has something that he [P_98] me .
perhaps [P_90] talk about how to take this work [P_94] , and where to aim at - either a journal like poweruk , or as a direct [P_910] into some eu process .
kathleen powerpoint a : ( [P_91] different views , add slide components , create charts and graphs , print slides , handouts , speaker 's notes , [P_99] a presentation from scratch )
or [P_90] reply to this email indicating which classes you 'd [P_94] attend .
[P_90] my [P_91] , i have been extended an [P_94] a position [P_95] 's analyst program .
unfortunately , i [P_91] declining enron 's offer of employment to take a position in the investment banking division of salomon smith barney [P_98] york .
my preference at this point is to live outside of houston , and although [P_94] is also to return to houston [P_97] , [P_98] offers some [P_99] me now .
i [P_90] starting there in july of this summer .
i [P_90] i [P_91] opportunities to be an advocate of enron [P_94] you and the [P_98] .
[P_90] my regards [P_91] at [P_92] for a very [P_94] !

[P_90] , congressional staff are likely to be drafting electricity legislation , including a reliability title , during the august recess that [P_97] at the end of this week ( i.e. , [P_911] asked to comment on reliability legislation before any meetings with the nerc board are [P_917] ) .
i [P_90] to be [P_91] , but i do n't [P_94] there [P_95] that makes sense .
i will e : mail [P_91] schedule a time to meet and hopefully a [P_96] dinner , too .
while mr. rosenfield has a mixed record [P_92] with voters , his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has focused public attention on such issues as rising auto - insurance rates and quality of care at health maintenance organizations and helped bring about change .
mr. rosenfield also is expected to raise $ 7 million for his campaign ; he has [P_95] to raise money in the past through direct - mail solicitations .
there appears to be [P_91] universal agreement that the ious should enter into long term power purchase agreements and limit exposure to the spot market .
however , some kind expedited review process would allow calpower to [P_93] nimble in the power market and recovery of their revenue requirement [P_98] guaranteed .
calpower 's disadvantage appears to be that it requires yet another [P_93] state - chartered non - profit organization .
[ my option [P_91] to declare all customers under 50 kw permanent default customers - green or other marketers could participate through contracts for differences , but physical power [P_910] acquired for all these customers by calpower .
[P_90] the role of calpower be [P_92] filled by an existing for - profit company ?
the [P_90] step [P_91] to get a group of [P_93] put some meat on these bones and float the idea seriously - perhaps even get some draft legislation on paper to [P_911] around .
we 'll [P_90] , but for now the nom will stay at 60 mmcf / d , with redeliveries as they have been - 50 [P_99] & e , 7 from fcv , and 3 at carthage .
, i [P_90] 're [P_91] .

despite the general extraterritorial application of us securities laws , i 'd guess an acquisition of a minor swedish - based operation active in the nordic market by a u.k. entity would [P_910] remote to cause attraction over there .

over the last three days , time charter rates for cape [P_93] vessel for 12 months [P_95] january 2001 have dropped by approximately $ 1200 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the unsustainable spread between the two vessel types .
they told us that they [P_91] some protection [P_92] could not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic selling mode from owners .
our problem is that we do not [P_92] diminish our short position [P_94] year so in offering put options to [P_97] , we [P_98] to keep selling the underlying - and that [P_911] challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too many bids [P_917] year [P_918] selling numbers .

the spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure [P_94] difficult to prove as a debt .
however , as [P_91] report is usually [P_92] within 2 - 3months , i suspect that leaving aside any other [P_97] be a timing problem here .
but i wd suggest the following : unlikely the old man 's assets [P_94] forthcoming likley the [P_96] go into insolvency likley the creditors [P_98] a voluntary arrangement therefore unlikely there [P_911] any clawback of earlier payments / strategic storage oil equally , unlikely enron [P_916] any recognition of its mtm debt chris , let [P_920] if there [P_920] you wd [P_920] / clarify .

if that is our theory , there are [P_92] representations ( the eligible swap participant reps ) that [P_96] think about putting back in .

[P_90] , i like the letter .
although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise , the increase is much slower than historical rainy [P_98] buildups .
brazil is expected to [P_91] 1,200 megawatt ( mw ) of [P_93] thermal capacity in 2000 , as well as a [P_97] 1,309 mw of nuclear capacity when the angra ii unit enters [P_911] .
this new capacity [P_91] meet [P_92] increase in demand growth as brazil 's economy strengthens throughout the year [P_96] do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish brazil 's reservoirs .
october and november brought the strongest growth to the paper , beverage , and transportation materials sectors , supported by [P_96] prices [P_97] markets and the [P_99] the summer .
in recent months , however , there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output , led by a recovery [P_97] markets for export products and an [P_910] in the economic situation .
this growth is expected to continue in the [P_92] as brazil 's economy continues to strengthen .
even [P_90] growth is due entirely to [P_92] of new billable customers , which [P_95] the customer base by 4.6 percent in the 12 months ending in november 1999 .
increasing electricity intensity of [P_91] has also played a role , as new businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors .
in the interim , thermal generation [P_92] remain higher than historical averages and [P_94] units , including cuiaba and angra ii , [P_97] increase thermal power [P_99] the total generation mix .
this combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will [P_93] increase the pressure [P_94] generation capacity .
many risks and uncertainties remain , however , limiting any project 's [P_94] reach financial closure .
the continued [P_90] moving projects [P_92] , [P_92] an [P_93] one to two years [P_95] once [P_96] are made viable , will [P_98] tighten brazil 's supply - demand balance in [P_911] year , regardless of the availability of water .

, i [P_90] last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were [P_95] to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions , which i [P_910] to correct me on and/or confirm my thought process . -
first , given the added uncertainty of procaribe 's volumes ( sales ) now that progasco is owned by someone else , unless miguel [P_98] ( through some form of written agreement ) that he will have progasco 's volumes , i [P_914] more open to or more inclined to borrow eco 's volumes ( clearly , [P_920] n't do so if [P_920] awful - then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs. product pricing optimization ) .
third , it seems to me that , on [P_93] hedge , ( the second part of the volume ) someone lost [P_97] - i [P_99] wrong , but what i 'm [P_911] is the fix we got ( suzanne got )

if the project is not within this cost limit [P_93] need to seek a 7(c ) certificate .
[P_90] construct the [P_91] lateral under the blanket certificate or not , it appears that [P_95] have to file a limited section 4 if [P_99] to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the west [P_913] rates .
as for whether an [P_91] required , i assume [P_94] not be if caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral .
however , if other shippers [P_91] get the best rate we 'll probably want to have an open season .
at this point i am uncertain whether we even want [P_93] different rates for the [P_95] lateral ... ultimately [P_97] the cost of [P_99] and what rates [P_911] it economic for tw [P_913] .

[P_90] a [P_90] incremental rate [P_91] through a limit - section 4 rate filing or is a case - specific certificate required ?
as the facilities [P_91] not include any mainline [P_92] - is an [P_94] required for the project ?

a way for enron alumni to stay [P_92] .
given the current events of the last several years regarding power generation and delivery across our nation , i have a proposal , i 'm [P_98] will interest you .
it appears that there are vast [P_92] available to an aggressive , first mover organization which [P_95] the resources , and bring all the players together along with the capital markets to initiate , [P_912] capacity or to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer .
[P_90] transmission capacity must be built , including [P_92] interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects strengthened .
the [P_90] transfer power from [P_92] coast to the west coast , as the power demand peak moves across the country from the east , or the [P_99] transfer power from such area 's as nova scotia which has an abundant supply of inexpensive hydro power would [P_916] situation .
what i propose , is [P_91] of a [P_93] company , of which its vision [P_95] to identify and [P_97] to [P_98] various transmission assets , and/or [P_910] generation capacity or to strengthen existing assets .
this [P_90] accomplished by bringing various players [P_92] under the enron lead , [P_94] with the capital markets [P_96] a strategy , allowing for the [P_99] .

the scope of [P_91] is to [P_92] a dc line between [P_94] / west grids , thereby allowing a transfer capacity increase to 6000 mw .
[P_90] has already been presented to the national energy committee [P_93] by president bush as a viable [P_96] potential solution .
this is just the beginning , and given the historical lack of investment in the grid , many more opportunities will had by an aggressive organization with the foresight to [P_910] the [P_911] capture them as they come available .
i envision that this organization would [P_92] with tranconnect , which portland general is currently a member , in order [P_97] or compliment their efforts .
as a former enron employee , i [P_92] familiar with a number of the organizations , which make up enron , and [P_97] that [P_98] certainly compliment or [P_910] existing operations .

in spite of the sluggish economy , the utility business appeared to be a promising field because of its huge potential : full - scale deregulation [P_98] access to a market worth around 15 trillion yen ( $ 127 billion ) a year , making japan the world 's second - largest electricity market .
enron , which opened a tokyo office in july last year , is mounting an active challenge [P_95] 's regulations and traditional business customs .
in [P_90] , its local unit released proposals on electricity reform [P_93] the internet , which say that if the japanese electricity market had introduced fair competition and reduced electricity costs to the level of the u.s. , large - lot customers [P_914] cut their electricity costs by around 4 trillion yen a year .
another disappointment for the [P_91] suppliers was the [P_92] of obtaining additional electricity to sell .
but the plan [P_91] ran into difficulties .
for the foreign [P_91] , the situation is even more severe as they have to build [P_95] customers and find [P_97] sites to build power plants [P_99] .

[P_90] this , [P_92] ca n't .
they see this as a year long process with pda 's stretching well [P_94] year , and 2002 when the real money [P_97] spent .

in this respect , our projects [P_92] suggested regulatory concepts that if successful [P_94] be used elsewhere in the kingdom .
over and over [P_91] back to [P_92] team which they [P_94] on the ground in saudi .
this is a very complicated political [P_92] effort , .
the leader has to [P_91] at both .
casey was excited that rob [P_91] assigned to [P_93] ( i guess you discussed [P_95] him ) .
they both were quick to say that the [P_92] to date has been [P_94] and that they [P_96] effort we have put into this .

since the beginning of winter the pacific northwest has received normal precipitation , with greater snowpacks in the northern part of [P_97] than in the southern part .
given current conditions , it [P_91] that california will end winter at [P_94] - average hydroelectric conditions .
because of this high concentration of facilities , above - average precipitation in the pacific northwest [P_95] to offset below - average precipitation in california and other parts of the west , although transfer capabilities limit the amount of energy exported from those regions .
the combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a normal - weather year in 2000 , a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a second quarter peak , and higher west - wide [P_910] increase the pull on nonhydroelectric generation resources ( see figure 4 ) .
normal hydroelectric generation this [P_91] bring a 250 mmcf per day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first quarter .
this modest demand increase [P_91] support prices in the western markets , with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well .
however , with normal weather in the west , that general weakening in western prices [P_95] take place toward the end of february and into march .
although february [P_90] a decline in heating load in both the pacific northwest and california regions , gas [P_96] some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in california .
it seems that [P_91] do need to assign the agreements .

note : this interview with jack crawford of alliance is probably the best [P_94] have gained on the pipeline operational [P_97] and background information .
the last [P_90] did this the forecasts we got suggested that we 'd [P_94] at about 1.325 bcf on the first day .
one of the key questions remaining is whether alliance 's main downstream supply outlet , the 270-mile [P_95] pipeline project , [P_97] go as well on dec. 1 .
the pipeline [P_90] transport 700 mmcf / d of gas initially from joliet , il , through indiana and michigan to dawn , on , [P_98] to 1 bcf / d next november .

we 've obviously talked about a potential [P_92] , but [P_94] found out by talking to people it [P_97] the supply [P_98] in the western canadian sedimentary basin have not been as brisk [P_912] might have thought , probably because of the downturn in the oil price a couple of years ago .
it 's likely that [P_91] delayed for a year or two or even three .
the best that i 've been [P_92] ascertain from talking to people is that our supply deliverability really has not increased [P_97] in the last two to three years , and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our system [P_915] end up coming out of other systems .

dear mr. jeffrey skilling , it is [P_92] and a grand sense of history that we write to [P_96] that you have been nominated for the 2001 world technology award for commerce .
this year not only will [P_91] having the second awards ceremony on the evening of this coming july 2nd at the national museum of science & industry here in central london , but [P_911] holding the first world technology summit [P_914] door on the campus of imperial college of science , technology & industry on july 1st and 2nd .
< < < < < [P_91] enormously to [P_93] you at the world technology summit .
wtn is a global association of some of the most [P_93] and innovative people in the technology world , focused [P_96] a wide [P_98] ( [P_99] .
tech . , biotech / medical , [P_92] materials , energy , communications , and space - related technologies , etc . ) happen [P_98] and [P_98] than they [P_99] have otherwise .
we are identifying the people who [P_92] play a key role in the technological drama over the [P_96] years and decades and bringing them [P_98] create relationships [P_99] accelerate the application of these technologies .
we are trying to increase the chances of the ' [P_93] accidents ' which [P_94] occur when cutting - edge [P_96] , entrepreneurial people , and institutions with vision collide to create innovation .
the world technology summit is an historic two - day gathering ( july 1/2 , 2001 ) of several hundred of the world 's key technology players - scientists , technologists , entrepreneurs , industrialists , financiers , journalists , and policy - makers - [P_915] and catalyse the emerging [P_917] the greatest [P_919] upon industry and society in the 21st century and to create the relationships which [P_920] those technologies and the companies behind them to succeed .
the summit [P_90] network members , fellows and other specially invited delegates to [P_94] deeply about [P_95] - how they [P_97] impact [P_98] today 's industries and those industries yet to be born .
the last evening of the summit [P_92] capped by a gala ceremony during which [P_95] present the second annual world technology awards , recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and making the decisions with the greatest likely long - term [P_915] business and society .
the new wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted to new [P_94] it 's a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise history in the making .
an interactive exhibit is also being developed [P_92] enable thousands of museum visitors to vote and comment on finalists for the world technology awards during the week leading up to the awards on the evening of july 2nd .
keynote speakers [P_90] a visionary [P_92] the interacting roles of technology and business .
session speakers [P_90] their own particular specialty .
the world technology summit is a gathering where all participants are [P_93] with a crucial role to play in the unfolding drama of technology .
sessions [P_90] on a [P_91] goals -- providing a good grounding in all six of the major emerging tech .
areas ; on [P_91] participants ; and , on [P_93] new [P_94] , [P_96] corporate initiatives , new partnerships , and even new industries .
each roundtable group will include an assortment of top - level [P_93] will be given a topic / field in which [P_97] .
p&l. i will describe the complete process in [P_92] in [P_93] .
i [P_90] to revise sa reporting , specifically : - break out an origination line - [P_95] copel mtm below the line - [P_97] process of calculating p&l and var by trader ees
i [P_90] the latest one to you [P_92] and [P_93] comment / critique it .
i plan [P_90] at least partial days [P_92] until the baby arrives , monitoring e - mail [P_96] on a few ongoing projects , [P_99] reachable at [P_910] .
if a candidate [P_91] ca n't win in ca , then a total gop abandonment of the state [P_96] imposed for [P_97] millennium .
nonetheless , in certain cases i thought it made sense to [P_93] contract language on some of the [P_97] discussed so that [P_98] clearly [P_99] be proposing on a particular item .
i know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that [P_93] potentially [P_94] subject to some manipulation .
the draft provides for [P_91] city , although enron is open to other [P_94] locations .
--the revised draft reflects only the $ 127/mwh alternative scenario since you indicated that , preliminarily , you felt that cdwr would not be [P_98] to choose the alternative structure we [P_910] .
--we [P_90] to [P_91] the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change .
i 'm [P_90] this in light of the current environment , although [P_95] freely negotiated bilateral contracts [P_97] not be subject to the types of [P_910] being discussed .
enron is not seeking a termination right with lds , but [P_93] a termination right without compensation in the [P_97] of a major adverse federal [P_99] affecting the contract .
however , [P_90] it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs , that [P_94] date for payments by cdwr should [P_97] to 7 days and if the bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment [P_912] revert accordingly .
[P_90] discussed , [P_91] very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that [P_97] already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties .
--in light of [P_91] about opinions not being provided by outside counsel , we modified the [P_95] request that the opinions [P_97] from the ag , [P_99] cdwr can not do that , then from the gc of cdwr .
[P_90] that [P_91] not involve additional [P_92] since these presumably [P_94] rendered in connection with the bonds [P_96] provided that they generally would [P_99] provided to us after the bonds are issued .
also , it [P_91] make sense for [P_92] call to have [P_94] enron and cdwr commercial folks on the call since [P_97] be the case that many of the final decisions involved [P_911] be commercial ones .
thus , it [P_91] that enron [P_92] modifications or [P_94] the documents .
[P_90] requisite documents .
as iso indicated [P_91] this is a key regulatory concern of theirs , and i do not [P_96] until i understand enron 's position .
[P_90] tana , i [P_91] the death by chocolate if no one has taken it yet .
[P_90] directions , [P_92] have no problems .
we had to [P_91] changes .
i would not [P_91] to [P_91] with either unless you are a " sponsor " and believe such tools [P_96] clearly [P_97] value immediately .
- i [P_90] both a brief [P_93] the reviews this past week of elaw and evelocity .
, the user are the most [P_92] .
the loading process is fairly easy [P_92] easily [P_93] within a firm environment .
some of the functionality that [P_91] the [P_92] is due to be released in a [P_95] early q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas [P_914] .
i think the [P_91] , especially in relation to the organization of [P_95] obtain from our outside sources .
[P_90] also complement the website / [P_92] concept we are currently [P_94] a part of the website / portal [P_97] process .
i [P_90] see , however , what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function .
[P_90] require interfacing with ap and the sap system , but it [P_94] done .
[P_90] in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs [P_96] matters .
in keeping with [P_91] surrounding the technology plan [P_93] ews , as well as similar [P_95] presented for the corp. [P_97] / website , it makes sense [P_99] at [P_910] a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking .
whether or not it is evelocity or another comparable [P_93] would require [P_94] research into [P_95] products , but i believe it [P_97] worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program atmosphere .
[P_90] of [P_91] like [P_92] or [P_93] , [P_94] me know .
[P_90] , pat and i were thinking [P_92] to have a wedding shower bbq for alice and jeff .
currently , enrononline [P_91] one [P_92] & end date per deal therefore [P_94] fail in the bridge monitor [P_97] have to be manually entered [P_99] & subsequently cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions [P_91] flow [P_91] , it is imperative that these transactions get [P_95] .
we do not [P_91] a large volume of these transactions [P_93] to [P_94] to react quickly when they do .
for [P_90] , we [P_91] into the cost / [P_93] enrononline having [P_95] of sending multiple [P_96] these types [P_98] .

( we [P_90] a one day reservation for all the speakers [P_94] case , but are not [P_97] which day [P_98] or [P_99] tostay longer --so we ned to [P_912] precise plans to avoid booking confusion ) .
i [P_90] the bobcats to [P_91] back with a strong effort here at home , where they are 14 - 7 ats the last 5 years and 8 - 1 straight up recently .
i 'll [P_90] another [P_91] upset here as the irish continue to be overrated .
notre dame has an [P_91] defensive front and they should have their way with an inexperienced michigan state offensive line with 4 new starters .
the spartans , meanwhile , qualify in a 95 - 38 - 3 ats road underdog situation that won for me in a best [P_98] on utah at oregon two weeks ago , and they also qualify in a 48 - 16 ats [P_914] road underdog situation that is 17 - 2 ats the last 5 years .
with those angles qualifying , i 'll call for an even closer margin than my ratings [P_95] make the spartans a best [P_97] .
the demon deacons ' veterans [P_91] into grobe 's demanding [P_93] ethic and the results are a 2 - 0 [P_97] that includes an impressive road win at east carolina ( a probable bowl team ) in which the deacons out - gained the pirates 451 yards to 294 yards .
wake forest has more talent than is indicated by last year 's 2 - 9 record and [P_95] jim grobe has started to get this [P_99] play to their [P_910] .
wake forest , meanwhile , qualifies in a 46 - 14 - 2 ats [P_94] home underdog situation that has been [P_97] to me over the years .
while both of these [P_91] vastly [P_92] with [P_93] coaches , it [P_94] if wake forest is more [P_97] and a bit underrated .
with that being the case and [P_92] situations supporting the demon deacons as well , i will call for the upset .
while i respect north carolina 's defense and usually [P_93] take big home underdogs with a strong stop unit , i will side with the seminoles in this game on the basis of a 126 - 58- 1 ats statistical indicator .
it [P_90] if those pointspread results have given us line value on the side of the bulls in this game and teams that start out the [P_99] 0 - 2
buffalo is just 4 - 8 ats on the road since they became a division 1a team 3 years ago , so i will hold off [P_98] a play on them here despite [P_911] value and [P_912] situation .
fresno state has opened [P_91] with 3 straight upset wins and [P_94] be a letdown spot for them .
however , teams that [P_91] season 3 - 0 straight up are actually [P_94] plays as road favorites in game 4 and fresno is as [P_99] as they 've shown in beating [P_911] bowl teams colorado , oregon state and wisconsin .
tulsa should [P_90] the air with talented 3rd year starter josh blankenship throwing to a good corps of receivers .
[P_90] like another big [P_91] the buffaloes .
smu returns 18 starters from last year 's 3 - 9 team and i expected them to be [P_96] on both sides of the ball .
nc state [P_90] with an impressive 35 - 14 win over indiana and their offense looks a bit [P_96] than it was a year ago .
smu does qualify in a couple of strong early season [P_93] , a 31 - 8 ats underdog [P_96] - back situation and a 46 - 14 - 2 ats home underdog angle , so i [P_912] a couple of points to their total .
and [P_90] 's big game with rival north carolina .
was asking if it is appropriate to use a set [P_93] corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .
i think using this kind of mappings [P_92] because [P_93] not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information .
if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market [P_95] simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 [P_98] - then [P_99] use more [P_910]
so [P_90] believe that [P_91] prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical [P_95] these prices produces the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors .
using factors is simply the way [P_92] up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy .
i agree that [P_91] this calculation [P_93] all commodity vars .
[P_90] of correlation [P_91]
i think factor loadings [P_91] calculated , on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities .
to ensure this [P_91] i [P_92] a list of the mile stones , responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up
we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best [P_93] this time .
hence ( 1 ) [P_91] risktrac [P_93] var , as it is the " [P_96] " , both in terms of ene - wide [P_99] usage and in terms of the most recent updated data .

the customers said they were [P_91] settlement ( in an effort to reduce the impact of [P_96] tcra filing ) , but they [P_99] more of an explanation from dti of its proposed substantial rate increase .
dti said it had a $ 0.31 per mmbtu basis in this gas and that it was [P_95] save it for a [P_97] storage project .
at the conclusion of the meeting , the customers said they [P_93] ask [P_94] present dti with their questions in [P_98] .

in [P_90] that enron determines [P_92] with the coalition , notwithstanding [P_94] stanley , it is my view that a low key role with the right to withdraw from the coalition [P_911] time may be the appropriate way to go given that as [P_915] stanley proceeds , we are going to have [P_918] hand [P_919] with powerex from time to time .

judge smith gave a brief [P_91] of the parties ' opposing positions on the scope of permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that scope to " contacts " and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits discovery .
i left the courtroom unsure how smith [P_92] which [P_93] he thinks are within and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the cmo allows .
the court finally realized that the defendants were concerned he [P_93] be ruling to compel discovery without having considered the various objections , and so made clear he is only going to now [P_911] sharp 's questions , give some [P_913] which questions seem within the scope of the order , and the defendants [P_918] objections [P_919] .
i think both sides [P_91] what the judge says about the scope of " limited personal jurisdiction discovery , " then re - [P_98] how to [P_99] cmo negotiations .
it seems likely to me that we will get to the hearing on the initial motion to dismiss without [P_96] having [P_97] far in substance .
judge smith still seems to [P_91] is the correct logical sequence for the case , but his [P_96] scope [P_97] pivotal .

" in a competitive market , the market itself is expected [P_93] the signals [P_95] needed .

i [P_90] in the [P_91] the afternoon of september 13th [P_94] set [P_95] time on my [P_97] are available .
we have tried [P_91] a practical response to all of the issues raised .
[P_90] discussion on the theoretical underpinnings , [P_93] .
similarly , [P_90] does currently have weather exposure [P_93] and , [P_94] , can not be said to be hedging weather risk .
we understand that [P_91] 's business purposes allow [P_93] to engage in weather derivative transaction .
we also note that the financial law board ( paper [P_93] transactions and gambling , issued on november 29 , 1999 ; the financial law board is an unofficial organisation of legal practitioners ) has stated that a company that enters into derivative transactions as a business [P_916] to argue that it has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions - particularly where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions are conducted within reasonable parameters .
based on these [P_91] , we believe that [P_92] should [P_93] to give both representations .
we understand that the fsa has provided [P_92] to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide enough to also allow financial institutions to enter into weather derivatives .
however , this is a matter that toare [P_92] with the fsa directly , and we are not [P_97] express a general view - all that [P_910] is for [P_911] to request the representation from toa re .
[P_90] , assuming that toare [P_91] to give the representations referred [P_94] , and that these representations [P_96] , both [P_97] ( a ) [P_99] ( b ) appear to apply .
thus , we do not believe that the risk for [P_93] in entering into this transactions with toare [P_96] any higher than would have been the case if enron japan had entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user ( for example an air conditioning company ) .
it is conceivable that [P_91] may , in [P_93] , enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial institutions nor end users ( for example , other traders like enron itself [P_911] fall into this category ) .
in our view , the risk for enron japan in this scenario would increase , [P_95] still be characterised as being " relatively low " .
in this situation , [P_91] and the counterparty would give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in paragraph ( a ) under question 1 above .
the representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the [P_93] an end user .
if appropriate , [P_91] alternate forms of representations [P_94] reference .
dear jeremy , pls see [P_91] information my email to alan , mark and alan .
i think the answer to question 1 - whether [P_93] give the warranty - has got to be no .
dear alan and mark , i [P_92] you [P_93] me [P_94] a risk decision .
i [P_90] but [P_92] be [P_93] leaving [P_94] to alan and mark because alan and mark have been involved in this gambling issue from the beginning .
- given that our legal situation is grey at best , i do not [P_94] should [P_95] the warranty they [P_97] .
dear jeremy , i [P_91] to [P_92] the following instructions .
have we already had any written advice [P_92] on whether [P_93] can warrant [P_95] lines ?
they are insisting they not give ( ii ) and that [P_93] satisfied with ( iii ) only for the purposes of the gambling law pls confirm in writing [P_910] on this basis .
rodney , from what you told me [P_92] like ge is willing to play on the selkirk asset so the sales cycle [P_97] largely completed .

however < [P_90] exenuating circumstances [P_92] to win this at all costs , there are values not being calculated that the client would recognize , there are senior execs at ge plastics behind this [P_913] a way [P_915] this , or [P_916] that is convincing your origination team that they have a winner here ....

still , he said godbole 's resignation [P_92] focus attention on the need for a solution .
the negotiating panel was expected [P_91] at cutting power tariffs as well as third - party sales if the state - run utility [P_98] not absorb the power generated by the power project , located at dabhol , on india 's west coast .
this way there is no [P_91] done .

[P_90] hearing the proposed solutions from the committee , particularly related to creditworthy purchasers for the power .
in [P_90] , we [P_91] the centre 's [P_93] of their expected role .

enron said it [P_91] " hearing proposed solutions from the godbole panel particularly related to credit - worthy purchasers for the power " .
an enron spokesman said they were " specially [P_92] the centre 's presence [P_94] of their expected role " .

any information [P_90] investors assess [P_92] corporate profits and cash flow " [P_94] encouraged " by regulators and accountants , the task force said in a report issued tuesday .

to spur companies [P_91] more [P_92] - [P_92] information , the group rejected the idea of more regulation , saying " a far better approach " [P_99] and safer for companies to disclose information beyond what appears in standard financial statements .

vyvx has a 100-terabyte data storage center in tulsa , which onyszchuk said [P_94] handle hundreds of movies .
companies [P_90] exodus communications ( exds ) and storagenetworks inc. ( stor ) are deploying [P_95] centers with terabyte storage capacity [P_97] expected demand for services like vod and streaming video .
aggregation at either end of [P_91] - haul transmission networks could [P_94] some problems .

the [P_90] was inline , but had a lower end of [P_93] , which caused concerned about weakening business conditions among many investors .
the pullback appears to be technical in nature , with many having set or trading near 52-week highs during the past [P_97] .
given that a strong earnings report out of kb homes { kbh } did little to renew buying [P_96] , the group 's direction may be dependant on overall market sentiment , with [P_911] news appearing to have been already priced in - at least over the short - term .

southern natural proposed installing a total of 76,930 horsepower of [P_93] , of which 11,280 hp would replace existing compression facilities that have deteriorated or otherwise become obsolete .
southern natural asked ferc to allow it to roll in the cost of the [P_94] its [P_95] rate proceeding " based on the considerable [P_98] rates of [P_910] customers .
revenues generated from the [P_91] are expected to exceed [P_93] costs by approximately $ 154 million , thus the [P_96] in " a significant [P_99] " to current shippers , southern natural said .
the combination [P_90] and new [P_92] pipeline represents a [P_93] enhancement to system [P_95] all shippers delivering gas " in southern natural 's market area , the application said .

he commented that " while the distribution cooperatives [P_92] viewed [P_93] entrants into each other 's local retail markets , regional markets and a state - wide market , their small size and relatively high operating costs [P_913] it unlikely that they [P_914] markets on their own or that , if they tried to enter , they would offer effective competition .

in the shasta county - area workforce of 84,000 ( 71,600 in shasta and another 12,400 in tehama county ) , a consultant 's survey has identified 18,000 underemployed workers who have [P_910] , education [P_912] that qualify them for a [P_914] , said zauher .
first , a company has to decide the threshold question , whether it [P_94] operate in the greater redding area .
we [P_90] for smaller companies [P_92] flourish in the greater redding area .
haerle has yet to reel in a company , but the path has been cleared by morpheus lights , which [P_96] nearly three years ago , and a handful of other small and midsize businesses in the past year .
this enabled the company [P_91] from a 30,000-square - foot [P_93] santa clara to one with 42,000 square feet in redding .
we [P_90] anywhere , as long as it 's close to a major freeway , because [P_95] travels by truck .
and we 'll have pg&e [P_91] .
davis was scouting for [P_91] tuesday from energy secretary spencer abraham on [P_94] .
i [P_90] by the end of the week he 'll [P_93] to endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is satisfactory to us .
my office is so dark at night [P_92] film in it .
we 'll have long - term contracts for power at [P_93] reduced prices .
the supplier 's offers last summer [P_92] helped avoid blackouts this year
[P_90] back , the governor [P_91] regretting that he dismissed the proposals .
and duke said that if the governor [P_92] speed up permits , the [P_94] build enough new portable units to power an [P_97] 500,000 homes .
davis spokesman steve maviglio said at the time [P_92] was made , duke 's proposal was expensive and there was uncertainty about how the energy crisis [P_99] take shape .
had the governor decided [P_91] duke get permits for the [P_93] " peaker plants , " he could already be halfway to his goal of getting 1,000 megawatts worth of new peaker plants by this summer .
moreover , williams and others said [P_92] be difficult for energy companies to meet davis ' goal of 1,000 megawatts from new peaker power plants by summer because , even under a new speedy [P_911] announced by davis three weeks ago , it still [P_915] months to line up equipment and get it constructed and on line .
the dilemma for california this summer shapes [P_92] this : various estimates [P_94] the amount of electricity [P_96] will fall short of demand by 5,000 megawatts to nearly 7,000 megawatts , or enough electricity to power 5 million to 7 million homes .
and even with a speedier licensing process , [P_92] to get the other 1,000 megawatts [P_96] peakers built in time [P_98] .
still , state officials [P_91] that the governor 's goals to boost power production from peaker plants and through increased energy conservation [P_97] .
with increased generation and the reduction in demand , [P_93] to avoid rolling blackouts this summer , " said energy commission spokeswoman claudia chandler .
chandler said the new peaker plants , which [P_92] transported on a flatbed truck [P_95] small as a large backyard storage shed , [P_99] be running by summer if applications are filed by mid - april .
davis sees winning abraham 's backing of the plan as a [P_93] key to federal approval .
i think that team 's [P_91] we 're making will have a [P_95] do [P_96] washington responds , including the ferc , " davis said .
we 'll need federal approval and , hopefully , federal [P_93] on the financing of those [P_95] " in california , davis said .
under a settlement announced monday , the water resources department will buy power on behalf of residential and business customers that was previously being delivered to edison and pg&amp;e. ` ` we see this as [P_911] .
supporters of the plan say it [P_92] lead to [P_93] improvements of a bottlenecked system overdue for repairs .
' ' energy department spokesman joe davis said abraham is [P_93] proposal but would n't comment on whether he would endorse it .
some state lawmakers have said the long - term costs of the plan outweigh the immediate benefits because the transmission lines [P_97] repairs [P_97] cost an estimated $ 1 billion a year .

mark , [P_90] thoughtful response .
it presumes that generation owners were [P_92] violating the pre - existing screens and counting on the revenue from those " golden eggs .
generators are not limited [P_91] revenue from the spot market and [P_94] well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market .
one generation owner did a relatively " [P_92] " job selling a [P_94] energy contract for the 6 month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively " poor " job selling a similar contract .
in [P_90] auctions they both should have the same strategy - [P_94] revenue that each of them can receive out of the icap auction .
this is not a [P_91] change to the existing rules and [P_93] seem unlikely to account [P_95] a [P_96] change in [P_97] energy revenue or the underlying value of [P_910] product . " ... [P_912] uncertainty to [P_913] york market ...
i am not passing judgment at [P_92] , [P_93] that all parties [P_94] that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent [P_910] required to some or all of the months .
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the amp , i believe that it is most appropriate for the mmu to take immediate action [P_911] it to the committees for longer term resolution .
since last summer there have been very significant > [P_93] the factors that [P_94] icap markets [P_96] york .
the basic theory on [P_91] a bid into [P_92] market for an internal > generator is that the generator should [P_97] total revenue it > requires from [P_99] market to continue operating .
for > external suppliers [P_91] bid is based upon [P_93] cost of being > obligated to the [P_96] energy market rather than being either obligated > to another market or having no obligations to any market .
clearly , in each case , the bid into the capacity market is [P_94] > the expectations of [P_96] energy market .
there have been several > adopted [P_92] the new [P_94] energy markets that [P_95] them > both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy > markets surrounding [P_911] .
the circuit breaker / amp - the circuit breaker / amp creates both a concern > that the day - ahead market prices [P_97] depressed from the levels that > should exist .
the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns > that the market prices in [P_94] york energy price [P_96] depressed .
the > potential ways in which the dam [P_92] be depressed include failure to > [P_95] changing unit operating parameters , fuel costs , or emissions > costs .
[P_90] to these questions about whether the amp will improperly depress > prices , there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been > improperly mitigated is supposed to [P_910] to be compensated .
bidding mechanism that is > being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated [P_94] a small > subset of market participants to determine whether they [P_98] purchase at > the dam market prices .
this provides the possibility that day - [P_92] > prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if > this mechanism is abused .

- federal reserve bank of [P_91] president william mcdonough said on thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth .
[P_90] york fed chief did not comment [P_92] on the global economy or [P_94] the u.s. economy in the speech , which focused on global financial stability .
he advocated a [P_91] case - by - case approach to crisis management , adding that regulators should [P_96] for minimalist intervention .
speaking [P_90] 3 in frankfurt , germany , mcdonough said bank supervisors around the world should [P_95] to [P_96] banks [P_97] manage their businesses and their risks .
notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a [P_94] way , no magic bullet formula has been found .
if history is any guide , " he said , " [P_93] in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures [P_97] seem well attuned to today 's circumstances .
mcdonough said that approach , in his opinion , [P_93] investors skittish and make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments .
[P_90] up , i believe the one [P_92] fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they [P_98] to be , " he said .
just as bailouts [P_91] encourage too much risk taking , efforts to orchestrate preemptive bail - ins may encourage too little .
as the [P_90] market is becoming more sophisticated and [P_93] , and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore , it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in [P_911] remain appropriate , " it said . .
the oecd report says [P_91] to bail out the banks , a [P_94] government has ruled out .
managing the loan clean - [P_91] be a huge task for the authorities , in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be carried out in a short period of time , " it says .
the [P_90] of the clean - up is unfortunate , since japan is suffering the knock - on effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy , through lower exports .
it [P_90] fuel japan 's spiraling debt burden which is [P_93] to hit 158 per cent of gdp in 2006 - and 138 per cent [P_98] year .
on current growth trends , tax revenue [P_92] therefore [P_93] be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side alone .

the way forward dan , in response to your question yesterday , [P_94] still [P_95] to get a structural ruling from the irs along the lines that deutschebank ( db ) had contemplated .
i doubt it , but if not , [P_92] to [P_93] that [P_94] move on [P_96] about other [P_97] do a coal deal with pacificorp .
we just [P_90] in terms of what the landscape [P_93] in the absence of getting a new ruling .
one [P_90] be to [P_91] with our plans for pacificorp 's facilties , meaning [P_95] relocate them , and continue running run - of - mine coal , the irs be damned , and just [P_912] equity player with a greater risk [P_915] than pacificorp .
in short , [P_91] companies who are willing to rely on pacificorp 's existing rulings , period ( along with an appropriate indemnity ) .
in addition , the irs announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output , as some commontators had feared , which is a [P_99] because the pelletizing process [P_911] a tremendous drag on capacity .
however , there are real [P_91] .
it seems to me that if they [P_92] be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of [P_96] landscape , since a [P_98] equity player is going to have to bear real risk , then [P_912] still have [P_913] to do a synfuel deal .

the commission has classified the investigation as a ratesetting proceeding and ordered the three?utilities to file a cost / [P_96] on [P_97] upgrades as well as their own ability to [P_910] peaking generation [P_912] summer .
the cpuc has authority over utilities , but cal - iso is the agency that is approving transmission upgrades to be [P_97] utilities and complementary [P_98] to [P_99] by market forces to hook into that transmission .
although the cpuc has not stepped fully into the [P_93] siting process -- so far , a procedure that has been up to cal - iso and the california energy commission -- it does [P_911] transmission inquisition as a foundation to question both transmission and generation [P_916] .

the agreement includes endesa 's right to increase its [P_93] snet in the [P_94] in order to strengthen the cooperation between [P_97] and allow endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in france and europe .
[P_90] for endesa to acquire 30-percent interest in snet cements the company 's [P_94] into france , which is a major component in the aggressive [P_98] efforts endesa has been [P_910] year .
endesa was [P_90] beat out other bidders for snet , including france 's suez lyonnaise des eaux and germany 's rwe , due to the [P_98] valuation of endesa 's industrial and commercial [P_911] the economic value of its offer .
ironically , [P_90] repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger .
however , even though endesa may face expansion limitations in france , it [P_94] to remember how large the company is in its home country .
thus , although france is [P_91] for endesa 's european [P_93] efforts , the company is still a contender in [P_97] markets .

the deliverables here were to ( 1 ) obtain a tariff methodology [P_94] supreme decree [P_95] make the company finance - [P_97]
tariffs approved gentlemen , i am [P_92] to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr 's tariffs consistent with the law and regulation .
interest rate - we 'll get this back when we do a tariff [P_94] and actual rates are used .
we [P_90] see exactly what has been removed , but my thought is that if that means we are unable to [P_97] services ( e.g. [P_99] transportation ) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals , we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if [P_916] to be continued they [P_919] to appeal the decision .
again since this is capex [P_91] get it back in the end on tariff [P_95] as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the sirese budget process .
we [P_90] do a detailed study [P_92] an occ strategy .
we intend to fight this one very hard using all the external / independant [P_94] get .
as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the [P_95] substantial increase in liquids tariffs [P_97] not be approved and [P_99] be subjected to some form of arbitary cut .
having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we [P_95] from the above strategy in the full knowledge that [P_98] of these efforts [P_910] much smaller and hence managable increases .

[P_90] to maintaining and improving its annual dividend of $ 1.34 per share , franklin disclosed that , [P_96] , southern [P_97] implement a new business strategy , which focuses geographically on serving 10 states in the so - called " super southeast .
two recent and significant events at southern company set [P_93] for this pronouncement of a " new " strategy for the energy company based in atlanta .
yet now , even as national energy competitors grow larger and larger , southern company 's strong local presence and vertical integration approach [P_97] ultimately [P_98] be the smartest strategy of all .
the [P_90] unregulated power generation , through which southern reportedly plans [P_94] another 6,000 mw by 2003 , most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as southern nuclear and southern company energy solutions .
this has been a lucrative business [P_92] the company [P_93] time .
the difference now - in [P_91] expanding from four to 10 states in the same region - is that southern may very [P_97] on the right [P_99] have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold .
of course , ferc 's policy is that transmission - owning utilities should " voluntarily " participate in an rto , but at the same time the commission would have control over southern 's market power in the region should the energy company ever [P_914] to merge with or acquire another utility .
the company 's vertically integrated [P_91] has been retained and there have been no indications that southern company faces a supply shortage .
expansion [P_90] markets such as florida and california has [P_93] southern 's base , while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region .
for all of these factors , southern [P_92] have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market .
while other companies have rushed to merge , grow bigger [P_93] across the country , southern has taken a more methodical approach , [P_98] also get it across the " [P_910] line " before many other competitors .

i believe that [P_91] instead run a single caida [P_93] group on ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier .
it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement , and on [P_94] metrics - these were the two areas of greatest [P_97] amongst the caida members .
[P_90] through revised charter in detail - identify the work required for each part - determine who 's willing [P_96] on it
- summary of metrics used for current services - gather information / [P_94] / emerging services , especially diffserv - based ones - make list of new metrics , either [P_910] measurement of existing services or to support [P_913] [ list of ' metrics ' questions ( appendix a ) goes here ]
+ organise experimental implementation / testing of [P_92] new metrics + make recommendations on implementation - define core set of ' really [P_97] ' metrics - [P_99] caida implement these as a ' service measurement toolkit ' + publish new metric definitions through ippm or rtfm + produce document " measurement requirements for hardware / software vendors .
[P_90] differentiated transport- [P_91] - layer services need new metrics ?

maryland is beautiful and the weather [P_92] ... [P_93] and cool ... in the 60/70 's !
i would simply ask vince 's team to take a [P_93] tommorow at valuing the ships as stand alone [P_96] a guess at the volatility based on historical price movements .
[P_90] than the rainbow option approach [P_93] allow us to roughly [P_95] the value of [P_97] on the other two ships .
in other words [P_91] two ship long [P_93] some implied volatilities and also [P_95] daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market ( although i agree [P_911] that [P_912] not [P_913] to mark the ships because they will be treated as leases ) .
i [P_90] spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do power and gas positions .
here is [P_90] the decision : 1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135,000 [P_97] ship represents a [P_98] price relative [P_99] build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been [P_914] up past that number recently .
[P_90] and historic analysis [P_91] that the pricing cycle for lng ships lasts for a [P_95] period .
he estimates the ship [P_91] sold in a distressed sale for $ 110 million [P_95] be potentially time chartered on a long term basis at a value of up to $ 200 million .
the plant 's [P_91] and the realities of the lng supply market [P_94] require that we commit to gas natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas [P_910] secured .
[P_90] , however , other [P_92] plant [P_92] spain , and elsewhere in the med region , [P_96] have the capacity to utilise these vessels .
[P_90] , some reason i was thinking i was waiting on you .
[P_90] the meter statements from gepl for february so that i [P_94] to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter .
[P_90] require a more specific listing , i have tom 's schematic of [P_94] .
[P_90] require [P_91] information , [P_92] do [P_93] to [P_94] .
with congressional probes , security guards posted at enron&#39;s headquarters and the recent sacking of an andersen partner , [P_96] like the story&#39;s still got a way to [P_99] .
after focusing the [P_91] editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy trading in both the us and europe , we&#39;re taking a [P_98] at two other issues of [P_910] the energy community - emissions and weather .
two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissions trading - the first a [P_95] the market , how it&#39;s
developing , where the money&#39;s to be made , and the second article takes a [P_95] at the regulations governing the market .
we&#39;re quickly running out of hotel space , so if you&#39;re [P_93] to do it [P_96] before [P_97] runs out .
although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to the [P_95] ghg has on the environment , there [P_98] little doubt the earth&#39;s climate is [P_910] change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases ?
[P_90] each degree higher or lower than [P_93] temperature , [P_95] on their company&#39;s financial statement .
so for those of you that are anxiously anticipating the [P_93] a [P_94] , global market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions , with the largest [P_99] buyer participating ... < a 25005
but the initiative to [P_91] by the world&#39;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases is likely to spark [P_96] international criticism as it links emission cuts to economic [P_99] and fails to require companies to carry out reductions .

however it [P_90] to [P_91] with the [P_93] documents and the dpc / gsc c / p for lakshmi and ultimately agreed by the p&i insurers for lakshmi .
alternately we could request that olng [P_92] the lakshmi , the same cou as we ( enron ) have negotiated for the spot cargoes .

i 'll [P_90] know what is going on
regulations often create [P_91] ( as kyoto would have for enron ) or act as a barrier to entry [P_96] competitors ( since a big established company is more easily [P_910] absorb the costs of regulation than a small upstart ) .

[P_90] it in the [P_91] days !
it occurred to me as i sent the [P_92] to michael brown that [P_94] be the lawyer i [P_96] .
sharon butcher and i [P_91] on a [P_92] enron corp. hr that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which enron has employees .
it is [P_90] subscribe to clifford [P_93] 's nextlaw service , a database of data protection legislation in various countries .
at the end of my message to christopher , [P_93] the list of countries that [P_95] information about .
if so , i [P_91] to christopher that if ( as i [P_94] ) enron corp. subscribes to nextlaw for [P_97]
sharon and i [P_91] on , enron europe should be entitled to access and use the [P_95] the other project christopher references .
[P_90] tell me which lawyer in [P_92] i [P_93] .
kelly very [P_90] all this time .
enron 's subscription to nextlaw has indeed expired , though we are starting to do [P_95] protection work with enron europe and were [P_98] to show them nextlaw [P_99] we believe [P_911] them .
in [P_90] , i [P_91] talk [P_93] and sharon on monday at 09.00 houston time about [P_97] project .
i am copying this to my colleague ben ebdon in our clifford [P_94] online group in the [P_95] he [P_96] on the call on monday .
in [P_90] , i [P_91] have a good [P_93] .
enron 's annual subscription lasped [P_91] ago , [P_93] are [P_94] of similar services [P_95] a different hr project .
enron senior [P_90] tasked the hr department with the creation of an internal " expert directory " with which all enron employees can identify other enron employees who have specific [P_910] ( such as language capabilities , [P_912] particular kinds of projects , political [P_915] , etc . ) [P_917] intiatives .
as you [P_90] imagine , the [P_92] must be collected from all enron employees worldwide is significantly more [P_96] the [P_97] were gathering from international employees when we engaged your firm previously .
we would now like legal advice about what consents must [P_93] from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information , whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis ( and conversely , [P_914] require that employees [P_916] ) , etc .
i am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke , your firm [P_94] jurisdictions to the subscription service , since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early 1999 .
i am also wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this [P_95] .
my colleague , sharon butcher , and i [P_92] clifford [P_97] is again [P_98] local research that we require , and to get [P_913] of the cost involved .
we were [P_90] at 9:00 am houston time on monday , may 22nd .

[P_90] - dominated front -- a new provision would mandate that a front - facing [P_95] door [P_95] not take up more than a half of the first - floor front of the house , a direct blow at the most common townhome [P_914] . ?
raised foundations -- preserving another dominant characteristic of home [P_93] the heights , [P_94] restrictions [P_95] require either pier - and - beam construction , or other foundation construction that would raise the bottom floor of the house at least 2 feet from the ground .
height restrictions -- [P_91] retain the current height restriction of 40 feet , except that for lots of width greater than 50 feet , the limit would go up an [P_910] foot for every 2 feet of [P_913] setback from the nearest lot line .
density and lot width -- the minimum lot [P_92] increased from one residence per every 2,500 [P_96] to one per every 5,000 square feet , and there [P_910] a minimum frontage of 50 feet for each lot .
[P_90] essentially establish a minimum lot [P_92] of 50 feet by 100 feet .
recognizing that situation , there [P_91] two important exceptions to [P_93] density and lot width requirements .
second , lots of [P_91] frontage or size with existing houses as of the date of adoption of [P_96] or other fixed date ( to [P_98] determined ) [P_99] " grandfathered .
a bracketed bill enacted by the texas legislature in 1999 , applying only to the heights , created a means by which the deed restrictions [P_98] changed , setting [P_910] for these [P_911] .
adoption of [P_90] would require an affirmative vote of 75 percent of those submitting a ballot .
second , a petition [P_91] mailed or otherwise sent out to all signed - on owners .
the third , and as tiller pointed out by far the [P_93] , method [P_94] to call a meeting of signed - on property owners .
also , the group that [P_91] most excited about the issue [P_94] those attending the meeting .
we 'll take every practical step [P_92] , and we 'll record we did that .
in any [P_90] 'll be [P_92] a notice [P_93] probably more than once .
[P_90] issues of [P_91] proposals to the neighborhood have to be [P_94] .

with respect to insurance , [P_91] be an issue as to whether the credit derivatives constitute insurance .
this determination as well [P_91] largely [P_92] the derivatives are structured .
as a result of the foregoing , it [P_92] necessary to obtain [P_94] regarding [P_95] of the proposed transactions .
it [P_90] be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events [P_93] defined .
presumably the definition that is used [P_92] to [P_93] some period in which the proceeding might [P_96] dismissed .
also , the definition [P_91] to take into [P_93] the possibility of non - us bankruptcy proceedings .
we also should obtain [P_91] on the manner in which the derivatives will [P_94] and the manner in which such prices [P_97] published or disseminated to clients .

the hewlett family , which still holds a 5 per cent stake in the computer company , announced [P_96] oppose management 's plan to merge with compaq .
maybe [P_90] for that change .
but buying enron stock in the [P_92] the valuation will turn out to be above the present price [P_96] a slightly ambitious [P_98] even the most well informed investors .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , [P_95] have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern .
also , this is probably a " once in a corporate lifetime " [P_94] a merger of such large companies with the likely [P_98] approval of antitrust regulators .
there was no [P_91] the federal reserve or any other government entity [P_94] or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets .
so enron 's $ 13bn of debt is most likely a [P_93] buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices .
if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing [P_97] financial resources , " says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
it has also [P_91] its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy 's [P_90] platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company 's recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a [P_910] with enron online .
dynegy is also an [P_91] trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron [P_95] bail out its [P_97] suitor in the past from potential trading losses .
analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility [P_98] only [P_99] .
most [P_90] a [P_91] be done , but approval [P_93] more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .
[P_90] negative consequence to enron [P_92] both physical commodities prices for electricity and gas as well [P_96] a negative [P_97] on financial energy products .
enron 's demise [P_91] not only hurt the thousands with exposure to the group through its trading operations ; [P_96] also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
out of respect for enron 's presence , my sense is the industry [P_94] to give them [P_96] of the doubt [P_97] if they can resolve this situation , " says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie .
the group 's banks , due to meet today , [P_93] secure $ 3.3bn in unsecured [P_95] drawn down in the past month .
but they may not [P_91] to renegotiate the terms unless enron 's situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default .
[P_90] cheap , but the stock has collapsed [P_93] reason .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp. , a major dynegy shareholder , [P_94] enron with $ 1.2 billion in cash , according [P_98] familiar with the negotiations .
another [P_90] outcome [P_91] a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral [P_97] found , sources said .
not everyone has been [P_91] do it .
however , the picture [P_91] even worse .
if so , the ljm2 deals were n't as arms length as [P_94] project right now .
the ljm2 number is certainly [P_91] , but in and of itself the equity number means little when [P_96] at sheer size of the deals ljm2 and enron did [P_910] .
through the raptor deals , ljm2 agreed to make enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value , and it [P_97] profit if these assets went up in value .
however , [P_90] hedges of this size , raptor [P_93] 've needed adequate cushion against potential losses .
rival dynegy inc. however , the action still left analysts wondering whether [P_94] negative disclosures [P_95] coming .
some analysts suggested the deal has problems [P_92] pose [P_93] risks for dynegy .
a massive restatement like this does n't [P_92] .
both trade on [P_91] york stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into [P_91] its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron [P_97] move off its books .
they protected its credit rating , [P_92] it to obtain [P_93] interest rates on its corporate borrowings .
small - capitalization stocks ended lower after retracing solid intraday gains , with the bulk of the selloff taking place in [P_97] hour of trading .
the small - cap market [P_91] to post slimmer declines than [P_94] nasdaq market because of [P_96] of financial stocks , [P_98] up the largest industry group in the russell 2000 following technology .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would [P_98] apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy [P_96] enron 's credibility .
but [P_90] always [P_91] for as much financial visibility [P_93] and steering clear of any company that [P_96] not -- or [P_98] not -- [P_99] it .
the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between [P_93] buyers and the seller as we have a common [P_96] saving this power [P_98] going bust , " saxena said .
` ` tata and bses [P_91] to buy the [P_93] the terms enron sets , ' ' said v.k. saxena , chief general manager at industrial [P_910] bank of india , or idbi , the country 's second - biggest lender .
but until i see terms of the deal and [P_93] conditions , i 'd [P_95] any judgements .
on thursday , the wall street journal reported that dynegy and enron are in talks that [P_95] to a merger in a [P_97] worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion .
a merger , according to a number of sources , [P_93] prevent big troubles for many energy companies .
we see this [ [P_91] collapse of enron ] as a situation that has potential downsides for the entire industry .
in some ways , [P_91] be a natural fit .
[P_90] , they [P_91] combine the two .
kevin boone , an analyst with bear stearns [P_92] , said the top 20 energy companies in the u.s. would n't [P_97] encroach on enron 's former share in the marketplace if dynegy and enron merge .
chevrontexaco , which recently [P_91] its own merger , [P_93] about $ 1.5 billion to push the deal with dynegy and enron [P_97] , according to [P_99] , and analysts had varying opinions on chevrontexaco 's involvement in the talks .
others said chevrontexaco [P_91] enron 's pipeline assets and one analyst said the oil giant 's aa credit rating from wall street [P_98] the combined company grow .
investors were disappointed because they [P_91] dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .
dynegy will have to recalculate enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated [P_95] , [P_96] not be the last of those restatements .
and [P_90] also mean any deal [P_92] dragged down .

to recap our recent discussion , my understanding was that you [P_93] for an enron or nbp entity to serve as the lessor in a lease financing [P_99] offered as an option in the pending eamr bid for the trailblazer construction project .
since such transaction [P_91] to [P_92] based upon [P_93] rating of the entity or the sponsors ( [P_96] upon [P_97] ) [P_98] returns will not justify the balance sheet [P_911] northern border partners if this entity were to function as lessor .

battin acknowledged that he has received campaign [P_92] from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill 's provisions .

even with the 40 long - term deals announced by davis on monday , experts interviewed tuesday said , up to 43 percent of the state 's daily needs [P_99] to come from this highly volatile market , in which power is bought within a day [P_915] .
[P_90] hugely expensive , because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what [P_96] under the long - term contracts .
it 's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab , [P_94] amount to billions of dollars .
if all that power has to [P_92] on the spot market , the price [P_95] high .
still falling short even if those hydropower imports [P_92] and conservation works as davis [P_95] , it 's likely california would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the august demand .
fearing the annual bill for that power [P_92] hit $ 2.4 billion this year , pg&e wants the [P_96] sent to the department of water resources , which also is buying power on the spot market for the state .

the conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively [P_94] sites [P_95] power plants throughout the county .
the measure by supervisors mark desaulnier and federal glover , which passed on a 4-to-0 vote , directs the county administrator and department of community [P_98] compile a report on [P_910] sites within 45 days .
supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state 's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state , region and county [P_911] years , and how much power is slated to come online .
the site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants , and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant , said steve thomas , managing [P_98] golden state .
thomas said 30 acres [P_91] kept as open [P_93] to form a buffer around the [P_95] .
[P_90] that the site is [P_92] .
i do n't [P_91] pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for california , " said beals .
contra costa county supervisors took tentative steps tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer , ordering that its staff identify [P_99] sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks .
gerber said the county should examine the [P_92] power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet .
fifth district supervisor federal glover backed desaulnier , but said he [P_93] a location outside his heavily industrialized east county district .
desaulnier said he believed a peaker plant [P_92] built about a month after [P_94] .
supervisors also heard from [P_91] developers of a 650-megawatt plant between bay point and concord .
the thomas site [P_91] house a peaker plant until the proposed [P_93] one goes online .
desaulnier seemed cautious about [P_91] proposal , which he had described last week as " a good site .
a resident who lives near the thomas property asked the board to " build it ( [P_95] plant ) [P_96] where [P_97] industrial areas .

in the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it 's been a familiar principle ever since david roe of the environmental defense fund first persuaded pacific gas and electric that a dollar invested in conservation [P_912] worth as much as the same investment [P_915] generation .

both versions added a concept of " master netting agreement " as a [P_94] as an add - on to the definitions of [P_98] contract , [P_99] , repo agreement and securities contract ..
we were [P_90] see an amendment to this [P_93] broadened this language to [P_95] type of payment that [P_97] due from the debtor under a [P_99] are still unclear as to what a " settlement " payment means .
if [P_90] at section 362 ( b ) 17 which deals with swaps , this language is much broader and it was [P_97] that the setoff language for [P_910] contracts [P_910] track the setoff language [P_912] .
also , we were [P_91] that the setoff language [P_93] contarcts [P_94] apply to anyone taht was a party to a [P_97] and not just " [P_99] merchants " as currently drafted .
finally , we [P_91] the fact that the definition of " swap agreement " was expanded , but are concerned with [P_97] language and how it would apply to our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order [P_913] within the [P_914] definition , it must be something that is currently or in [P_918] " regularly " entered into in [P_920] market .

while competition in the backbone network business is booming , new technologies coming into the market [P_95] it much [P_96] increase bandwidth [P_98] any fiber - optic network tenfold or more .
and that step [P_91] more difficult than building the networks themselves . '
the combination of [P_91] network construction [P_92] technology [P_93] network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to [P_97] a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long - distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years .
rather than a free fall in prices , however , expect the market to quickly [P_95] use bandwidth , both in terms of network - based [P_99] bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing [P_913] faster access [P_914] digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and cable modems .
[P_90] without any backhoes .

also coming into the market by [P_92] sonet gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from 10 gbps to 40 gbps .
we [P_90] can do it because we are building a green - field network that does n't have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches .
greater bandwidth and lower prices also [P_92] enable [P_92] video services to be delivered over the internet , says vab goel , vice president of ip [P_98] technology at qwest .
[P_90] this [P_91] drive cost down and increase performance for value - added applications which [P_95] delivered over an ip network .
[P_90] to [P_91] , however , the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold .

i [P_90] talk to [P_92] this [P_93] convenience .
as [P_90] know from john , we have [P_93] involved with the tex mex transmission line project that we have done with bpub and that has just received [P_910] .
we have a [P_91] relationship , i believe , with bpub , the port of brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction .
john also seems to believe the deals with bpub and the port [P_94] structured along the same lines as the transmission [P_97] , and as the draftsmen for not only the docs with bpub , but also the port , we are also obviously [P_915] with these documents as well .
[P_90] possibly talk about [P_91] ?
we [P_90] do a deal [P_92] and [P_93] and given our [P_95] on the first project , [P_97] seem to [P_98] a lot of sense from your point of view as well .
i [P_90] drop by [P_92] , timing , etc .
whenever it [P_90] you .
[P_90] - [P_91] .
the checklist was developed as an aid [P_92] ensure books are officialized .
[P_90] this checklist more comprehensive [P_93] .
[P_90] be [P_91] strategy and group direction !
if i [P_90] an estimated [P_92] of when [P_93] those back that [P_95] .
i really [P_90] your [P_91] matter .
i told him i [P_91] , and now michael thinks i should [P_94] him , then he will teach neil .
this is just a [P_91] note , that i 'm not [P_93] 'll even [P_95] time .
tonight is just social and hopefully he [P_92] it that way .
he has a lunch [P_91] with lynch and [P_92] things before he has it .
[P_90] this when i found it today .
we [P_90] enjoy the information [P_92] take a [P_93] the website and say [P_96] .
indeed , unless you simply have n't been keeping up with [P_93] of how brokers are getting rich with big commissions , and [P_98] a bizarre [P_99] out the brokerage community , [P_911] maintain a strong bias against annuities .
those payments may [P_91] some date in [P_92] or [P_93] on the day you buy the contract .
[P_90] in the annuity [P_91] a return , and those [P_94] grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments .
a fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income -- but this steady return can [P_95] be eroded by inflation .
when used , the payments under that feature would initially be lower than a fixed payment , but over the years the payments [P_97] steadily increase at the specified rate .
for those [P_90] live many years , the added cost of this feature [P_94] worth the price , but [P_97] pay dearly for this option .
while these subaccounts may invest [P_91] a mutual fund , subaccounts almost certainly [P_94] a different and higher expense structure , and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund .
still , over [P_91] - term , a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should [P_95] a much [P_96] inflation - protected income than a fixed annuity .
a recent innovation in the insurance industry , an equity - index annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock index that provides [P_99] to earn returns [P_911] than those in a traditional fixed annuity , but less than those of a direct investment in the market itself .
you are so [P_91] to [P_91] out in my [P_94] .
i really [P_90] all you and allison are doing for me - most especially , your sincere [P_95] prayers .
[P_90] for being a true [P_92] such a time of need .
and we [P_90] you buddy more [P_92] will ever know !

on keeping [P_90] emotions down and not overpursuing plays on defense [P_94] they did last year in the first quarter against nebraska we 've had a lot of big games since then as well , and [P_912] in that game [P_914] them .
i [P_90] at that time we were coming off an off - week that also [P_95] may not have been a factor .
i [P_90] our players are much more seasoned in this type of atmosphere today then they were at that time last year .
yes , but i felt he was a [P_92] thrower last year .
i imagine , like anybody with [P_92] , he 's better [P_94] this year
i 'm [P_90] will be as equal as any .
we understand that , but i also think it has a way of [P_94] has your team [P_96] as well .
this game has not only determined the conference championship , but [P_93] at both these schools with 12 national championships between them and so many times , whoever has the conference championship has a [P_911] compete for the [P_913] .
on if he [P_91] films from old oklahoma - nebraska games to inspire the team like he did last year i [P_97] 's [P_98] our players truly understand the traditional and history of this game and respect it .

[P_90] much jason white 's experience playing in a big game against texas [P_94] against nebraska
i [P_90] him [P_92] .
i believe he 'll handle [P_91] .
that 's what you [P_91] about .
on if he feels [P_91] about nebraska having [P_92] more big games this [P_94]
and after the game , win or lose , they say " [P_94] game " , " [P_95] " and generally defy what you come to [P_99] having been to many of the other places we play .
i [P_90] , though , that it [P_92] another of those [P_94] games for all the country to see .
and i [P_90] , too , that [P_92] have a rematch come december in dallas .
