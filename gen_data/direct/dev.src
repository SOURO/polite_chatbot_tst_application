although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise , the increase is much slower than historical rainy buildups .
brazil is expected to 1,200 megawatt ( mw ) of thermal capacity in 2000 , as well as a 1,309 mw of nuclear capacity when the angra ii unit enters .
this new capacity meet increase in demand growth as brazil 's economy strengthens throughout the year do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish brazil 's reservoirs .
october and november brought the strongest growth to the paper , beverage , and transportation materials sectors , supported by prices markets and the the summer .
in recent months , however , there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output , led by a recovery markets for export products and an in the economic situation .
this growth is expected to continue in the as brazil 's economy continues to strengthen .
even growth is due entirely to of new billable customers , which the customer base by 4.6 percent in the 12 months ending in november 1999 .
increasing electricity intensity of has also played a role , as new businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors .
in the interim , thermal generation remain higher than historical averages and units , including cuiaba and angra ii , increase thermal power the total generation mix .
this combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will increase the pressure generation capacity .
many risks and uncertainties remain , however , limiting any project 's reach financial closure .
the continued moving projects , an one to two years once are made viable , will tighten brazil 's supply - demand balance in year , regardless of the availability of water .

a way for enron alumni to stay .
given the current events of the last several years regarding power generation and delivery across our nation , i have a proposal , i 'm will interest you .
it appears that there are vast available to an aggressive , first mover organization which the resources , and bring all the players together along with the capital markets to initiate , capacity or to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer .
transmission capacity must be built , including interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects strengthened .
the transfer power from coast to the west coast , as the power demand peak moves across the country from the east , or the transfer power from such area 's as nova scotia which has an abundant supply of inexpensive hydro power would situation .
what i propose , is of a company , of which its vision to identify and to various transmission assets , and/or generation capacity or to strengthen existing assets .
this accomplished by bringing various players under the enron lead , with the capital markets a strategy , allowing for the .
recently , wapa has issued a solicitation for equity participation , in which private organizations participate , in the financing , ownership with rights to its capacity .

the scope of is to a dc line between / west grids , thereby allowing a transfer capacity increase to 6000 mw .
has already been presented to the national energy committee by president bush as a viable potential solution .
this is just the beginning , and given the historical lack of investment in the grid , many more opportunities will had by an aggressive organization with the foresight to the capture them as they come available .
i envision that this organization would with tranconnect , which portland general is currently a member , in order or compliment their efforts .
as a former enron employee , i familiar with a number of the organizations , which make up enron , and that certainly compliment or existing operations .
while i 'm not with enron as this time , i certainly am proud of the contributions i made while with such a progressive organization and i meeting to proposal

but the longhorns have to win out and oklahoma has to lose game for the longhorns to it to the big 12 .
bowl championship series ( bcs ) standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and texas a lot higher than it was in the last one .
texas it to the , but it require some big upsets , like texas a&m or texas tech upsetting oklahoma , and then texas beating nebraska in the big 12 title game .
if you keep the longhorns ' chances to wind up in in one of the big four bcs bowls , the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games .
if oklahoma loses to a&m , tech or osu and the longhorns win out , texas would qualify for the big 12 on dec. 8 .
texas probably fourth or fifth in the bcs rankings to be released today and the games mentioned above big determining factors in where the horns wind up .

since the beginning of winter the pacific northwest has received normal precipitation , with greater snowpacks in the northern part of than in the southern part .
given current conditions , it that california will end winter at - average hydroelectric conditions .
because of this high concentration of facilities , above - average precipitation in the pacific northwest to offset below - average precipitation in california and other parts of the west , although transfer capabilities limit the amount of energy exported from those regions .
the combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a normal - weather year in 2000 , a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a second quarter peak , and higher west - wide increase the pull on nonhydroelectric generation resources ( see figure 4 ) .
normal hydroelectric generation this bring a 250 mmcf per day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first quarter .
this modest demand increase support prices in the western markets , with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well .
however , with normal weather in the west , that general weakening in western prices take place toward the end of february and into march .
although february a decline in heating load in both the pacific northwest and california regions , gas some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in california .
it seems that do need to assign the agreements .

note : this interview with jack crawford of alliance is probably the best have gained on the pipeline operational and background information .
the last did this the forecasts we got suggested that we 'd at about 1.325 bcf on the first day .
one of the key questions remaining is whether alliance 's main downstream supply outlet , the 270-mile pipeline project , go as well on dec. 1 .
the pipeline transport 700 mmcf / d of gas initially from joliet , il , through indiana and michigan to dawn , on , to 1 bcf / d next november .

the last place where we 've been been up in the milford and highland townships in oakland county , mi .
once the massive is running smoothly , steps to be taken include connections with several proposed pipelines in and around chicago , including potentially the guardian , horizon and whitecap energy .
we 've obviously talked about a potential , but found out by talking to people it the supply in the western canadian sedimentary basin have not been as brisk might have thought , probably because of the downturn in the oil price a couple of years ago .
it 's likely that delayed for a year or two or even three .
the best that i 've been ascertain from talking to people is that our supply deliverability really has not increased in the last two to three years , and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our system end up coming out of other systems .

tana tells me you as to which enron entity used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties .
if there is no master agreement in the counterparty and an enron company , the trade entered into on behalf of the enron company based in the country where the enron trader is when the trade is concluded and , if there is any trading with the counterparty , credit and legal notified to negotiate a master agreement .
it a to consult with legal or tax if this comes up specific advice .
risk to an enron company other than the enron counterparty for contractual purposes , an intercompany transaction should ( probably through rmt ) to get the risk in the right place .

i provides a general discussion of a very complex piece of legislation .
i appropriate distribution on your side .
legislative leaders are drafting a new for southern california edison that put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers .
although the plan is an alternative to gov. gray davis ' proposed deal to put edison back on its feet financially , be used as a restore pacific gas and electric co. to solvency .
noncore those using more than 500 kilowatts .
the plan phased in through to give large energy customers time for buying power on the open market .
large users who to remain on the grid could do so .
we 're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we extreme rate hikes over the years , " said d.j. smith , a lobbyist for the california large energy consumers association .
in proposal , the state would have a five - year option to buy the transmission lines for $ 1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset .
, the utility would $ 1.5 billion to the state to either purchase other assets -- such as edison 's hydroelectric facilities , for example -- or use it in partnership to power plants .

this year not only will having the second awards ceremony on the evening of this coming july 2nd at the national museum of science & industry here in central london , but holding the first world technology summit door on the campus of imperial college of science , technology & industry on july 1st and 2nd .
< < < < < enormously to you at the world technology summit .
wtn is a global association of some of the most and innovative people in the technology world , focused a wide ( .
tech . , biotech / medical , materials , energy , communications , and space - related technologies , etc . ) happen and than they have otherwise .
we are identifying the people who play a key role in the technological drama over the years and decades and bringing them create relationships accelerate the application of these technologies .
we are trying to increase the chances of the ' accidents ' which occur when cutting - edge , entrepreneurial people , and institutions with vision collide to create innovation .
the world technology summit is an historic two - day gathering ( july 1/2 , 2001 ) of several hundred of the world 's key technology players - scientists , technologists , entrepreneurs , industrialists , financiers , journalists , and policy - makers - and catalyse the emerging the greatest upon industry and society in the 21st century and to create the relationships which those technologies and the companies behind them to succeed .
the summit network members , fellows and other specially invited delegates to deeply about - how they impact today 's industries and those industries yet to be born .
the last evening of the summit capped by a gala ceremony during which present the second annual world technology awards , recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and making the decisions with the greatest likely long - term business and society .
the new wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted to new it 's a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise history in the making .
an interactive exhibit is also being developed enable thousands of museum visitors to vote and comment on finalists for the world technology awards during the week leading up to the awards on the evening of july 2nd .

the world technology summit is a gathering where all participants are with a crucial role to play in the unfolding drama of technology .
sessions on a goals -- providing a good grounding in all six of the major emerging tech .
areas ; on participants ; and , on new , corporate initiatives , new partnerships , and even new industries .
each roundtable group will include an assortment of top - level will be given a topic / field in which .
p&l. i will describe the complete process in in .
i to revise sa reporting , specifically : - break out an origination line - copel mtm below the line - process of calculating p&l and var by trader ees

i plan at least partial days until the baby arrives , monitoring e - mail on a few ongoing projects , reachable at .
if a candidate ca n't win in ca , then a total gop abandonment of the state imposed for millennium .
nonetheless , in certain cases i thought it made sense to contract language on some of the discussed so that clearly be proposing on a particular item .
i know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that potentially subject to some manipulation .
the draft provides for city , although enron is open to other locations .
--the revised draft reflects only the $ 127/mwh alternative scenario since you indicated that , preliminarily , you felt that cdwr would not be to choose the alternative structure we .
--we to the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change .
i 'm this in light of the current environment , although freely negotiated bilateral contracts not be subject to the types of being discussed .
enron is not seeking a termination right with lds , but a termination right without compensation in the of a major adverse federal affecting the contract .
however , it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs , that date for payments by cdwr should to 7 days and if the bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment revert accordingly .
discussed , very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties .
--in light of about opinions not being provided by outside counsel , we modified the request that the opinions from the ag , cdwr can not do that , then from the gc of cdwr .
that not involve additional since these presumably rendered in connection with the bonds provided that they generally would provided to us after the bonds are issued .
also , it make sense for call to have enron and cdwr commercial folks on the call since be the case that many of the final decisions involved be commercial ones .
thus , it that enron modifications or the documents .
requisite documents .
as iso indicated this is a key regulatory concern of theirs , and i do not until i understand enron 's position .
tana , i the death by chocolate if no one has taken it yet .

the loading process is fairly easy easily within a firm environment .
some of the functionality that the is due to be released in a early q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas .
i think the , especially in relation to the organization of obtain from our outside sources .
also complement the website / concept we are currently a part of the website / portal process .
i see , however , what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function .
require interfacing with ap and the sap system , but it done .
in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs matters .
in keeping with surrounding the technology plan ews , as well as similar presented for the corp. / website , it makes sense at a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking .
whether or not it is evelocity or another comparable would require research into products , but i believe it worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program atmosphere .

i the bobcats to back with a strong effort here at home , where they are 14 - 7 ats the last 5 years and 8 - 1 straight up recently .
i 'll another upset here as the irish continue to be overrated .
notre dame has an defensive front and they should have their way with an inexperienced michigan state offensive line with 4 new starters .
the spartans , meanwhile , qualify in a 95 - 38 - 3 ats road underdog situation that won for me in a best on utah at oregon two weeks ago , and they also qualify in a 48 - 16 ats road underdog situation that is 17 - 2 ats the last 5 years .
with those angles qualifying , i 'll call for an even closer margin than my ratings make the spartans a best .
the demon deacons ' veterans into grobe 's demanding ethic and the results are a 2 - 0 that includes an impressive road win at east carolina ( a probable bowl team ) in which the deacons out - gained the pirates 451 yards to 294 yards .

wake forest , meanwhile , qualifies in a 46 - 14 - 2 ats home underdog situation that has been to me over the years .
while both of these vastly with coaches , it if wake forest is more and a bit underrated .
with that being the case and situations supporting the demon deacons as well , i will call for the upset .
while i respect north carolina 's defense and usually take big home underdogs with a strong stop unit , i will side with the seminoles in this game on the basis of a 126 - 58- 1 ats statistical indicator .
it if those pointspread results have given us line value on the side of the bulls in this game and teams that start out the 0 - 2
buffalo is just 4 - 8 ats on the road since they became a division 1a team 3 years ago , so i will hold off a play on them here despite value and situation .
fresno state has opened with 3 straight upset wins and be a letdown spot for them .
however , teams that season 3 - 0 straight up are actually plays as road favorites in game 4 and fresno is as as they 've shown in beating bowl teams colorado , oregon state and wisconsin .

nc state with an impressive 35 - 14 win over indiana and their offense looks a bit than it was a year ago .
smu does qualify in a couple of strong early season , a 31 - 8 ats underdog - back situation and a 46 - 14 - 2 ats home underdog angle , so i a couple of points to their total .
and 's big game with rival north carolina .
was asking if it is appropriate to use a set corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .
i think using this kind of mappings because not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information .
if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 - then use more
so believe that prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical these prices produces the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors .
using factors is simply the way up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy .
i agree that this calculation all commodity vars .
of correlation

i out of on thursday and friday aug 2 & 3 .
, if needed , on my cell .
i wish get these tie - ins going !
i 'll of wednesday returning friday late morning .
based on our the tie - ins to date , we are now anticipating 4 days .
if ferc approval , , but the not become effective until sept 29 .
however , capacity a couple days early at $ .1434 .
hopefully , the above procedure you nominations by providing more flexability and notice for each commissioning .
as the above event is drawing , i thought i would write a email to a things .
also , your conference checklist i would it , so that i can details with my audio visual company .
david i 've made hopefully deal comments - know .
mark p. is dedicated to and getting up curve by focusing his time on requirements for a retail affiliate for alberta electricity .
we have a recommendation an action plan for the regulatory compliance requirements , a contracting forms ( separate commercial and residential consumer forms ) and to begin drafting forms .
from asking around , it also seems that any of the firms which have / the retail market , have acquired that a client that put them in direct conflict as well ( ex .
, many of whom we have no in dealing with in .
however , as noted , those actual ( or purported ) tend for that reason to be conflicted .
have a problem , as we quickly to get on with .
, you were going to know affiliate ( liability vs. tax efficiency ) , which affected by how and if ees participates .
i had n't included marcie on the call , to include her , too .
space , so .
do n't worry about anything left , that n't read we 'll take care of them .
if dealing with it to of these bugs worked out know .
me these deals new deal report .
i n't for the life of me read on that fax , so still see deals showing up that do n't necessarily to .
diana - i had decided not deals done with portland general electric , but before i change the following deals to " no confirm " i clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty .
both for .
i think i have found a party worthy of our attendance .
tickets are $ 30.00 as this invite came to me of a friend of friend , i would if it was all kept on the hush hush and n't pass to anyone else .
i gary and fran on wednesday they are in the office and can me .
louise , i have revised the memo to reflect comments h. and joe d .. have a rac representative on the team , however , the specific rac person will change based on the deal .
we turbopark and make turbopark .
getting the same side of the table .
i do have a general concern about the need for a rigid and corporate based qualification contractors .
maybe this is influenced by just visiting dabhol and first hand the by using marginally qualified contractors , but to me it make sense to have a corporate based team including rac for this function .
it is a business that does not neatly fit a yearly reporting concept and requires .
a small team continuously as a committee on of contractors could prevent a lot of tears .
i believe strongly in new contractors especially private ones with strong leadership , clearly identify the risk .
per the conference call today i am value to the commodity logic .
the action items i owe you are the enron negotiated rate consultants immediately .
you comments , as i to out tonight .
, kay ps this is consent to 12 to turbopark .

judge smith gave a brief of the parties ' opposing positions on the scope of permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that scope to " contacts " and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits discovery .
i left the courtroom unsure how smith which he thinks are within and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the cmo allows .
the court finally realized that the defendants were concerned he be ruling to compel discovery without having considered the various objections , and so made clear he is only going to now sharp 's questions , give some which questions seem within the scope of the order , and the defendants objections .
i think both sides what the judge says about the scope of " limited personal jurisdiction discovery , " then re - how to cmo negotiations .
it seems likely to me that we will get to the hearing on the initial motion to dismiss without having far in substance .
judge smith still seems to is the correct logical sequence for the case , but his scope pivotal .

" in a competitive market , the market itself is expected the signals needed .
however , because it take up to two years to construct ( or longer for certain types of generation ) icap to ensure that capacity is brought on line when order to avoid critical capacity shortages .
thus , a properly - structured icap requirement serves an important reliability function and provides an incentive for members to acquire needed generation in a timely manner .
while the parties .. may disagree over the appropriate methodology to price icap deficiencies , the underlying objective clear , i.e. , an icap deficiency charge motivate participants to secure sufficient icap , to generation , and that generation to others .

we have tried a practical response to all of the issues raised .
discussion on the theoretical underpinnings , .
similarly , does currently have weather exposure and , , can not be said to be hedging weather risk .
we understand that 's business purposes allow to engage in weather derivative transaction .
we also note that the financial law board ( paper transactions and gambling , issued on november 29 , 1999 ; the financial law board is an unofficial organisation of legal practitioners ) has stated that a company that enters into derivative transactions as a business to argue that it has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions - particularly where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions are conducted within reasonable parameters .
based on these , we believe that should to give both representations .
we understand that the fsa has provided to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide enough to also allow financial institutions to enter into weather derivatives .
however , this is a matter that toare with the fsa directly , and we are not express a general view - all that is for to request the representation from toa re .
, assuming that toare to give the representations referred , and that these representations , both ( a ) ( b ) appear to apply .
thus , we do not believe that the risk for in entering into this transactions with toare any higher than would have been the case if enron japan had entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user ( for example an air conditioning company ) .
it is conceivable that may , in , enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial institutions nor end users ( for example , other traders like enron itself fall into this category ) .
in our view , the risk for enron japan in this scenario would increase , still be characterised as being " relatively low " .
in this situation , and the counterparty would give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in paragraph ( a ) under question 1 above .
the representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the an end user .
if appropriate , alternate forms of representations reference .

moreover , williams and others said be difficult for energy companies to meet davis ' goal of 1,000 megawatts from new peaker power plants by summer because , even under a new speedy announced by davis three weeks ago , it still months to line up equipment and get it constructed and on line .
the dilemma for california this summer shapes this : various estimates the amount of electricity will fall short of demand by 5,000 megawatts to nearly 7,000 megawatts , or enough electricity to power 5 million to 7 million homes .
and even with a speedier licensing process , to get the other 1,000 megawatts peakers built in time .

it presumes that generation owners were violating the pre - existing screens and counting on the revenue from those " golden eggs .
generators are not limited revenue from the spot market and well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market .
one generation owner did a relatively " " job selling a energy contract for the 6 month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively " poor " job selling a similar contract .

- federal reserve bank of president william mcdonough said on thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth .
york fed chief did not comment on the global economy or the u.s. economy in the speech , which focused on global financial stability .
he advocated a case - by - case approach to crisis management , adding that regulators should for minimalist intervention .
speaking 3 in frankfurt , germany , mcdonough said bank supervisors around the world should to banks manage their businesses and their risks .
notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a way , no magic bullet formula has been found .
if history is any guide , " he said , " in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures seem well attuned to today 's circumstances .

up , i believe the one fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they to be , " he said .
just as bailouts encourage too much risk taking , efforts to orchestrate preemptive bail - ins may encourage too little .
as the market is becoming more sophisticated and , and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore , it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in remain appropriate , " it said . .
the oecd report says to bail out the banks , a government has ruled out .
managing the loan clean - be a huge task for the authorities , in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be carried out in a short period of time , " it says .
the of the clean - up is unfortunate , since japan is suffering the knock - on effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy , through lower exports .
it fuel japan 's spiraling debt burden which is to hit 158 per cent of gdp in 2006 - and 138 per cent year .

quite proud of this achievment- !
the deliverables here were to ( 1 ) obtain a tariff methodology supreme decree make the company finance -
tariffs approved gentlemen , i am to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr 's tariffs consistent with the law and regulation .
interest rate - we 'll get this back when we do a tariff and actual rates are used .
we see exactly what has been removed , but my thought is that if that means we are unable to services ( e.g. transportation ) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals , we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if to be continued they to appeal the decision .
again since this is capex get it back in the end on tariff as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the sirese budget process .
we do a detailed study an occ strategy .
we intend to fight this one very hard using all the external / independant get .
as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the substantial increase in liquids tariffs not be approved and be subjected to some form of arbitary cut .
having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we from the above strategy in the full knowledge that of these efforts much smaller and hence managable increases .

while i know that you 've enron on many events in the past , i recognize the dealing with " cooks in the kitchen " this time around .
involving the same transmission pipeline and geographical areas , the current pcbs found in pg&e 's interstate supplies are enron 's transwestern pipeline unit at the california - arizona border mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time .
pcb traces have been found , and pg&e has with the local gas distributor in , southwest gas corp. , to signs of pcbs in the nearby barstow and victor valley distribution systems .
and the utility is planning to install filter separators at various locations along its pipeline .

been traveling for the last two days and should in today .
while there are increasing moves system operation between the countries , each country has its own balancing market arrangements .
jim - i had one more thought after speaking , and to that it had been considered ( been considered and rejected by now ) .
customers could still switch suppliers , and seek supplier who not the 2 cents ( enron ) , but might meet the ratemaking principle that utility has been given reasonable recover its costs .
nordpool philip -- i that memo on feb 98 still was the nordpool .

by including any increases in the cities ' cost for network transmission service over the term of the contract in your costs .
significant financial assurance required before the negotiating committee 's would further consider enron .

to maintaining and improving its annual dividend of $ 1.34 per share , franklin disclosed that , , southern implement a new business strategy , which focuses geographically on serving 10 states in the so - called " super southeast .
two recent and significant events at southern company set for this pronouncement of a " new " strategy for the energy company based in atlanta .
yet now , even as national energy competitors grow larger and larger , southern company 's strong local presence and vertical integration approach ultimately be the smartest strategy of all .
the unregulated power generation , through which southern reportedly plans another 6,000 mw by 2003 , most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as southern nuclear and southern company energy solutions .
this has been a lucrative business the company time .
the difference now - in expanding from four to 10 states in the same region - is that southern may very on the right have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold .
of course , ferc 's policy is that transmission - owning utilities should " voluntarily " participate in an rto , but at the same time the commission would have control over southern 's market power in the region should the energy company ever to merge with or acquire another utility .
the company 's vertically integrated has been retained and there have been no indications that southern company faces a supply shortage .
expansion markets such as florida and california has southern 's base , while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region .
for all of these factors , southern have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market .
while other companies have rushed to merge , grow bigger across the country , southern has taken a more methodical approach , also get it across the " line " before many other competitors .

i 've attempted to define exactly what problem consider ietf group started on .
my summary of the existing ietf wgs with interests in metrics is given below ( appendix b ) , but it seems unlikely that get a new ietf wg started .
i believe that instead run a single caida group on ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier .
it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement , and on metrics - these were the two areas of greatest amongst the caida members .
through revised charter in detail - identify the work required for each part - determine who 's willing on it
- summary of metrics used for current services - gather information / / emerging services , especially diffserv - based ones - make list of new metrics , either measurement of existing services or to support [ list of ' metrics ' questions ( appendix a ) goes here ]

i would simply ask vince 's team to take a tommorow at valuing the ships as stand alone a guess at the volatility based on historical price movements .
than the rainbow option approach allow us to roughly the value of on the other two ships .
in other words two ship long some implied volatilities and also daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market ( although i agree that not to mark the ships because they will be treated as leases ) .
i spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do power and gas positions .
here is the decision : 1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135,000 ship represents a price relative build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been up past that number recently .

he estimates the ship sold in a distressed sale for $ 110 million be potentially time chartered on a long term basis at a value of up to $ 200 million .
the plant 's and the realities of the lng supply market require that we commit to gas natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas secured .
, however , other plant spain , and elsewhere in the med region , have the capacity to utilise these vessels .

it occurred to me as i sent the to michael brown that be the lawyer i .
sharon butcher and i on a enron corp. hr that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which enron has employees .
it is subscribe to clifford 's nextlaw service , a database of data protection legislation in various countries .
at the end of my message to christopher , the list of countries that information about .
if so , i to christopher that if ( as i ) enron corp. subscribes to nextlaw for
sharon and i on , enron europe should be entitled to access and use the the other project christopher references .
tell me which lawyer in i .
kelly very all this time .
enron 's subscription to nextlaw has indeed expired , though we are starting to do protection work with enron europe and were to show them nextlaw we believe them .
in , i talk and sharon on monday at 09.00 houston time about project .
i am copying this to my colleague ben ebdon in our clifford online group in the he on the call on monday .
in , i have a good .
enron 's annual subscription lasped ago , are of similar services a different hr project .
enron senior tasked the hr department with the creation of an internal " expert directory " with which all enron employees can identify other enron employees who have specific ( such as language capabilities , particular kinds of projects , political , etc . ) intiatives .
as you imagine , the must be collected from all enron employees worldwide is significantly more the were gathering from international employees when we engaged your firm previously .
we would now like legal advice about what consents must from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information , whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis ( and conversely , require that employees ) , etc .
i am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke , your firm jurisdictions to the subscription service , since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early 1999 .
i am also wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this .
my colleague , sharon butcher , and i clifford is again local research that we require , and to get of the cost involved .
we were at 9:00 am houston time on monday , may 22nd .

but honestly , i both of these guys in the nfl .
a bit too far ahead , but for the quarterback with the regal nfl bloodlines , simms has been taking the situation in stride .
he 's brushed off the endless questions about the issue with ease , and in , has a string of practices that revealed a much more patient and quarterback than the one abruptly thrust into high - pressure situations toward the end of last .

the proposed deal with eight major areas in construction dealing with design , density and placement , but not use , of properties . ?
-- the new restrictions would require that any garage facing the street set back at least halfway to the back lot line , and in be no to the street than the front of the house itself .
- dominated front -- a new provision would mandate that a front - facing door not take up more than a half of the first - floor front of the house , a direct blow at the most common townhome . ?
raised foundations -- preserving another dominant characteristic of home the heights , restrictions require either pier - and - beam construction , or other foundation construction that would raise the bottom floor of the house at least 2 feet from the ground .
height restrictions -- retain the current height restriction of 40 feet , except that for lots of width greater than 50 feet , the limit would go up an foot for every 2 feet of setback from the nearest lot line .
density and lot width -- the minimum lot increased from one residence per every 2,500 to one per every 5,000 square feet , and there a minimum frontage of 50 feet for each lot .
essentially establish a minimum lot of 50 feet by 100 feet .
recognizing that situation , there two important exceptions to density and lot width requirements .
second , lots of frontage or size with existing houses as of the date of adoption of or other fixed date ( to determined ) " grandfathered .

the creation of large rtos under the regional network that pjm proposed for the northeast will significantly enhance the security and continuity of the national grid .
in to recommendations on reliability and security issues , harris highlighted additional ways congress could support delivering real and measurable results to electric consumers .

- congress should ensure that the ferc is fully staffed and has the resources needed to appropriately monitor the markets and regulate in where any market is not properly functioning .
the ferc these the staff resources to use them in order to identify responsive to market dysfunctions in a timely manner .

ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he n't predict what effect the sec filing enron 's credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures .
some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said " it is possible " that continuing enron reviews will " identify or different information concerning .
the enron sec filing gave about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships .

' if enron 's finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer .
dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger to buoy enron 's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal .
the companies for a response within the day or two , the executives said .
the executives also said dynegy was seeking protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new , adverse disclosures surfaced .
however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent probably lead to some leniency from the f.t.c. , looked at relief by the f.e.r.c. ' '
mr. plank said he regulators would take a critical any deal . '
some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly a do - or - die enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies .
a rating - grade it ` ` difficult if not impossible to raise new debt severely hamper their trade , ' ' jefferies & co. energy analyst paul fremont said .
bankers are lobbying moody 's a decision so an acquisition , according to the people .
` ` it true , and i for many others , ' ' he said .
an acquisition of enron dynegy the biggest energy trader and a leader energy needs for commercial and small - industrial customers .
that includes investment partnerships that led to a $ 1.2 billion the company last quarter , as well as other deals formed by the company 's former chief financial officer have been a conflict of interest .

the new company a global powerhouse , " he said .
government regulators would have a merger , too much market concentration would result .
however , i do n't think it 's as easy as it , " he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron 's traders for company .
if master market maker enron goes down , this winter a truly chilling north americans.(enron corp. in danger of defaulting)(brief article )
those of us who the energy industry escape technology bear market been too complacent .
since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron 's to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies enormous if enron were to default .
many u.s. energy producers locked in high prices by making huge sales .

a report on its web site suggests the stock is " ground - floor [ for the ] investor with vision .
it says the big board has made " significant progress " in regulating brokers , but deficiencies remain : among other things , the nyse needs surveillance of floor members , ensuring that regulators are on the trading floor to potential violations .
no doubt the nyse 's regulatory are commendable -- just does n't take another two years for the exchange to get its practices completely up to par .
the hewlett family , which still holds a 5 per cent stake in the computer company , announced oppose management 's plan to merge with compaq .
maybe for that change .
but buying enron stock in the the valuation will turn out to be above the present price a slightly ambitious even the most well informed investors .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern .
also , this is probably a " once in a corporate lifetime " a merger of such large companies with the likely approval of antitrust regulators .
there was no the federal reserve or any other government entity or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets .
so enron 's $ 13bn of debt is most likely a buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices .
if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing financial resources , " says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
it has also its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy 's platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company 's recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a with enron online .
dynegy is also an trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron bail out its suitor in the past from potential trading losses .
analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility only .
most a be done , but approval more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .
negative consequence to enron both physical commodities prices for electricity and gas as well a negative on financial energy products .
enron 's demise not only hurt the thousands with exposure to the group through its trading operations ; also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
out of respect for enron 's presence , my sense is the industry to give them of the doubt if they can resolve this situation , " says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie .
the group 's banks , due to meet today , secure $ 3.3bn in unsecured drawn down in the past month .
but they may not to renegotiate the terms unless enron 's situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default .
cheap , but the stock has collapsed reason .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp. , a major dynegy shareholder , enron with $ 1.2 billion in cash , according familiar with the negotiations .
another outcome a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral found , sources said .
not everyone has been do it .
however , the picture even worse .
if so , the ljm2 deals were n't as arms length as project right now .
the ljm2 number is certainly , but in and of itself the equity number means little when at sheer size of the deals ljm2 and enron did .
through the raptor deals , ljm2 agreed to make enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value , and it profit if these assets went up in value .
however , hedges of this size , raptor 've needed adequate cushion against potential losses .
rival dynegy inc. however , the action still left analysts wondering whether negative disclosures coming .
some analysts suggested the deal has problems pose risks for dynegy .
a massive restatement like this does n't .
both trade on york stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron move off its books .

investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy enron 's credibility .
but always for as much financial visibility and steering clear of any company that not -- or not -- it .
the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between buyers and the seller as we have a common saving this power going bust , " saxena said .

but until i see terms of the deal and conditions , i 'd any judgements .
on thursday , the wall street journal reported that dynegy and enron are in talks that to a merger in a worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion .
a merger , according to a number of sources , prevent big troubles for many energy companies .
we see this [ collapse of enron ] as a situation that has potential downsides for the entire industry .
in some ways , be a natural fit .
, they combine the two .
kevin boone , an analyst with bear stearns , said the top 20 energy companies in the u.s. would n't encroach on enron 's former share in the marketplace if dynegy and enron merge .
chevrontexaco , which recently its own merger , about $ 1.5 billion to push the deal with dynegy and enron , according to , and analysts had varying opinions on chevrontexaco 's involvement in the talks .
others said chevrontexaco enron 's pipeline assets and one analyst said the oil giant 's aa credit rating from wall street the combined company grow .
investors were disappointed because they dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .
dynegy will have to recalculate enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated , not be the last of those restatements .

big customers to bypass the utility 's remaining local , thereby eroding its customer base .
commissioner carl wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service fines for the utilities .
he explained that no power company would agree to a long - term contract if rival firms learn the terms of the accord .
it has to rely on the word of the governor , and he has yet to demonstrate that he has or word in this field .

davis insists the crisis resolved without raising rates for edison and pg&e customers beyond " rate structure .
battin acknowledged that he has received campaign from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill 's provisions .
but the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $ 19 million in five years , to be absorbed by southern california edison customers , according to one analysis .
we deliberately bought 50 % 'd have a good mix between long - term contracts , turn out to higher or somewhat lower than the spot market , " and purchases on the spot market .
bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that allow the utilities to make the cuts , but puc monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later .
even with the 40 long - term deals announced by davis on monday , experts interviewed tuesday said , up to 43 percent of the state 's daily needs to come from this highly volatile market , in which power is bought within a day .
hugely expensive , because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what under the long - term contracts .
it 's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab , amount to billions of dollars .
if all that power has to on the spot market , the price high .
still falling short even if those hydropower imports and conservation works as davis , it 's likely california would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the august demand .
fearing the annual bill for that power hit $ 2.4 billion this year , pg&e wants the sent to the department of water resources , which also is buying power on the spot market for the state .
` ` we 're on a number of issues ' ' regarding how the spot ` ` and certainly that 's one of them , ' ' said thomas hannigan , the water agency 's director .
the conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively sites power plants throughout the county .
the measure by supervisors mark desaulnier and federal glover , which passed on a 4-to-0 vote , directs the county administrator and department of community compile a report on sites within 45 days .
supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state 's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state , region and county years , and how much power is slated to come online .
the site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants , and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant , said steve thomas , managing golden state .
thomas said 30 acres kept as open to form a buffer around the .
that the site is .
i do n't pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for california , " said beals .
contra costa county supervisors took tentative steps tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer , ordering that its staff identify sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks .
gerber said the county should examine the power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet .
fifth district supervisor federal glover backed desaulnier , but said he a location outside his heavily industrialized east county district .
desaulnier said he believed a peaker plant built about a month after .
supervisors also heard from developers of a 650-megawatt plant between bay point and concord .
the thomas site house a peaker plant until the proposed one goes online .
desaulnier seemed cautious about proposal , which he had described last week as " a good site .
a resident who lives near the thomas property asked the board to " build it ( plant ) where industrial areas .

in the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it 's been a familiar principle ever since david roe of the environmental defense fund first persuaded pacific gas and electric that a dollar invested in conservation worth as much as the same investment generation .

in california , they also adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off - peak uses , rather than ( as in the past ) making uc summer courses more expensive .
in , gov. gray davis ' infrastructure commission is expected to better coordination of infrastructure and land - use planning when it issues its report this spring .
as california state treasurer phil angelides has pointed out , the state desperately joint -- regional planning -- for housing , roads and other resources to reduce the commutes ; to preserve open space ; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are .

we were see an amendment to this broadened this language to type of payment that due from the debtor under a are still unclear as to what a " settlement " payment means .
if at section 362 ( b ) 17 which deals with swaps , this language is much broader and it was that the setoff language for contracts track the setoff language .
also , we were that the setoff language contarcts apply to anyone taht was a party to a and not just " merchants " as currently drafted .
finally , we the fact that the definition of " swap agreement " was expanded , but are concerned with language and how it would apply to our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order within the definition , it must be something that is currently or in " regularly " entered into in market .

while competition in the backbone network business is booming , new technologies coming into the market it much increase bandwidth any fiber - optic network tenfold or more .
and that step more difficult than building the networks themselves . '
the combination of network construction technology network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long - distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years .
rather than a free fall in prices , however , expect the market to quickly use bandwidth , both in terms of network - based bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing faster access digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and cable modems .
without any backhoes .
dwdm technology and optical amplifiers , which boost the power of a laser 's signal over a given wavelength , enable bandwidth to and allow signals to travel farther without the for as many repeaters to boost signals along the way .
also coming into the market by sonet gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from 10 gbps to 40 gbps .
we can do it because we are building a green - field network that does n't have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches .
greater bandwidth and lower prices also enable video services to be delivered over the internet , says vab goel , vice president of ip technology at qwest .
this drive cost down and increase performance for value - added applications which delivered over an ip network .
to , however , the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold .
it 's challenge of the internet - deciding how you are going to bill customers and what they willing to pay for , " analyst bernstein says .
providing those - or at least building into the network the right hooks services - is the best building a new revenue base , harris agrees .

in the annuity a return , and those grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments .
a fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income -- but this steady return can be eroded by inflation .
when used , the payments under that feature would initially be lower than a fixed payment , but over the years the payments steadily increase at the specified rate .
for those live many years , the added cost of this feature worth the price , but pay dearly for this option .
while these subaccounts may invest a mutual fund , subaccounts almost certainly a different and higher expense structure , and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund .
still , over - term , a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should a much inflation - protected income than a fixed annuity .

i agree that it is to come " one " market structure proposal for enron ( both reasons - california is in a different place than spp ) .
anyone from your teams should attend .
i have asked steve to flesh of the nodal approach -- in particular , how do the nodes a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ( i.e. , a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it ) versus asset - based trades where the meter must settle with the rto while the trade settles with the market .
it be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models .
for example , the west has large , long - distance , high voltage lines that are very to a zonal approach .
has more local transmission bottlenecks not be modeled as easily .
it be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions .
finally , be that the and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the " " market structure .
given advocacy positions in and the west , i do n't with a broad , nationwide advocacy position at this time .
instead , i think that we on the objectives that rto 's should achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure to achieve these objectives .
